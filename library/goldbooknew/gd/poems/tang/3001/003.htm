<blockquote><b><i>AN OLD AIR</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>There once was a man, sent on military missions,
<br>A
wanderer, from youth, on the You and Yan frontiers.
<br>Under the horses' hoofs he would meet his foes
<br>And,
recklessly risking his seven-foot body, <br>Would slay
whoever dared confront
<br>Those moustaches that bristled like
porcupinequills.
<br>...There were dark clouds below the hills, there were
white
clouds above them,
<br>But before a man has served full time, how can he go
back?
<br>In eastern Liao a girl was waiting, a girl of fifteen
years,
<br>Deft with a guitar, expert in dance and song.
<br>...She
seems to be fluting, even now, a reed-song of home,
<br>Filling every soldier's eyes with homesick tears.

<blockquote><b><i>ON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET <br> A POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>When this melody for the flageolet was made by Lady
Cai,
<br>When long ago one by one she sang its eighteen
stanzas,
<br>Even the Tartars were shedding tears into the border
grasses,
<br>And the envoy of China was heart-broken, turning back
home
with his escort.
<br>...Cold fires now of old battles are grey on ancient
forts,
<br>And the wilderness is shadowed with white new-flying
snow.
<br>...When the player first brushes the Shang string and
the Jue
and then the Yu,
<br>Autumn-leaves in all four quarters are shaken with a
murmur.
<br>Dong, the master,
<br>Must have been taught in heaven.
<br>Demons come from the deep pine-wood and stealthily
listen
<br>To music slow, then quick, following his hand,
<br>Now far
away, now near again, according to his heart.
<br>A hundred birds from an empty mountain scatter and
return;
<br>Three thousand miles of floating clouds darken and
lighten;
<br>A wildgoose fledgling, left behind, cries for its
flock,
<br>And a Tartar child for the mother he loves.
<br>Then river
waves are calmed
<br>And birds are mute that were singing,
<br>And Wuzu tribes are homesick for their distant
land,
<br>And out of the dust of Siberian steppes rises a
plaintive
sorrow.
<br>...Suddenly the low sound leaps to a freer tune,
<br>Like a
long wind swaying a forest, a downpour breaking
tiles,
<br>A cascade through the air, flying over tree-tops.
<br>...A
wild deer calls to his fellows. He is running among the
mansions
<br>In the corner of the capital by the Eastern Palace
wall....
<br>Phoenix Lake lies opposite the Gate of Green Jade;
<br>But
how can fame and profit concern a man of genius?
<br>Day and night I long for him to bring his lute
again.

chill.

another;

<br>I am the madman of the Chu country
<br>Who sang a mad song disputing Confucius.
<br>...Holding
in my hand a staff of green jade, <br>I have crossed,

morning at the Yellow Crane Terrace,
<br>All five Holy Mountains, without a thought of
distance,
<br>According to the one constant habit of my life.
<br>Lu
Mountain stands beside the Southern Dipper <br>In
clouds
reaching silken like a nine-panelled screen,
<br>With its shadows in a crystal lake deepening the green
water.
<br>The Golden Gate opens into two mountain-ranges.
<br>A
silver stream is hanging down to three stone bridges
<br>Within sight of the mighty Tripod Falls. <br>Ledges
of
cliff and winding trails lead to blue sky
<br>And a flush of cloud in the morning sun, <br>Whence
no
flight of birds could be blown into Wu. <br>...I climb
to the
top. I survey the whole world. <br>I see the long
river that
runs beyond return, <br>Yellow clouds that winds have
driven
hundreds of miles
<br>And a snow-peak whitely circled by the swirl of a
ninefold
stream.
<br>And so I am singing a song of Lu Mountain,
<br>A song that is born of the breath of Lu Mountain.
<br>...Where the Stone Mirror makes the heart's purity
purer
<br>And green moss has buried the footsteps of Xie,
<br>I have
eaten the immortal pellet and, rid of the world's
troubles,
<br>Before the lute's third playing have achieved my
element.
<br>Far away I watch the angels riding coloured clouds

hands.

world,
<br>I will follow Saint Luao up the Great Purity.

<br>In a

China
<br>With the hundred-mile length of the Heavenly Terrace
Range,
<br>Which, just at this point, begins turning
southeast.

lights my shadow
<br>And me to Yan River --
<br>With the hermitage of Xie still there
<br>And the monkeys calling clearly over ripples of green
water.

<br>Up a ladder of blue cloud,
<br>Sunny ocean half-way,
<br>Holy cock-crow in space,
<br>Myriad peaks and more valleys and nowhere a road.
<br>Flowers lure me, rocks ease me. Day suddenly ends.
<br>Bears, dragons, tempestuous on mountain and river,
<br>Startle the forest and make the heights tremble.
<br>Clouds
darken with darkness of rain,
<br>Streams pale with pallor of mist. <br>The
Gods of Thunder and Lightning <br>Shatter the
whole range.

shadow.

terrace,
<br>And, clad in rainbow garments, riding on the wind,
<br>Come
the queens of all the clouds, descending one by one,
<br>With tigers for their lute-players and phoenixes for
dancers.
<br>Row upon row, like fields of hemp, range the fairy
figures.
<br>I move, my soul goes flying,
<br>I wake with a long sigh,
<br>My pillow and my matting
<br>Are the lost clouds I was in.
<br>...And this is the way it always is with human
joy:
<br>Ten thousand things run for ever like water toward the
east.
<br>And so I take my leave of you, not knowing for how
long.

<br>And ride to you, great mountain, when I have need of
you.

<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>On Wheel Tower parapets night-bugles are blowing,
<br>Though the flag at the northern end hangs limp.
<br>Scouts, in the darkness, are passing Quli,
<br>Where, west
of the Hill of Gold, the Tartar chieftain has  halted
<br>We can see, from the look-out, the dust and black
smoke
<br>Where Chinese troops are camping, north of Wheel
Tower.
<br>...Our flags now beckon the General farther west-
<br>With bugles in the dawn he rouses his Grand Army;
<br>Drums like a tempest pound on four sides
<br>And the Yin Mountains shake with the shouts of ten
thousand;
<br>Clouds and the war-wind whirl up in a point
<br>Over fields
where grass-roots will tighten around white bones;
<br>In the Dagger River mist, through a biting wind,
<br>Horseshoes, at the Sand Mouth line, break on icy
boulders.
<br>...Our General endures every pain, every hardship,
<br>Commanded to settle the dust along the border.
<br>We have
read, in the Green Books, tales of old days-
<br>But here we behold a living man, mightier than the
dead.

<blockquote><b><i>A DRAWING OF A HORSE BY GENERAL CAO <br> AT SECRETARY WEI  FENG'S HOUSE</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>Throughout this dynasty no one had painted horses
<br>Like
the master-spirit, Prince Jiangdu -- <br>And then to
General
Cao through his thirty years of fame
<br>The world's gaze turned, for royal steeds. <br>He
painted the late Emperor's luminous white horse.
<br>For ten days the thunder flew over Dragon Lake,
<br>And a pink-agate plate was sent him from the palace-

<br>The talk of the court-ladies, the marvel of all
eyes.
<br>The General danced, receiving it in his honoured
home
<br>After this rare gift, followed rapidly fine silks
<br>From
many of the nobles, requesting that his art <br>Lend a
new
lustre to their screens.
<br>...First came the curly-maned horse of Emperor
Taizong,
<br>Then, for the Guos, a lion-spotted horse....
<br>But
now in this painting I see two horses, <br>A sobering
sight for whosoever knew them. <br>They are war-
horses.
Either could face ten thousand.
<br>They make the white silk stretch away into a vast
desert.
<br>And the seven others with them are almost as noble
<br>Mist
and snow are moving across a cold sky, <br>And hoofs
are
cleaving snow-drifts under great trees-
<br>With here a group of officers and there a group of
servants.
<br>See how these nine horses all vie with one another-

<br>The high clear glance, the deep firm breath.
<br>...Who
understands distinction? Who really cares for art?
<br>You, Wei Feng, have followed Cao; Zhidun preceded
him.
<br>...I remember when the late Emperor came toward his
Summer
Palace,
<br>The procession, in green-feathered rows, swept from
the
eastern sky --
<br>Thirty thousand horses, prancing, galloping,
<br>Fashioned,
every one of them, like the horses in this
picture....
<br>But now the Imperial Ghost receives secret jade from
the River
God,
<br>For the Emperor hunts crocodiles no longer by the
streams.
<br>Where you see his Great Gold Tomb, you may hear among
the
pines
<br>A bird grieving in the wind that the Emperor's horses
are
gone.

<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>O General, descended from Wei's Emperor Wu, <br>You
are
nobler now than when a noble.... <br>Conquerors and
their
velour perish,
<br>But masters of beauty live forever. <br>...With
your
brush-work learned from Lady Wei <br>And second only
to
Wang Xizhi's, <br>Faithful to your art, you know no
age,
<br>Letting  wealth and fame drift by like clouds.
<br>...In
the years of Kaiyuan  you were much with the Emperor,
<br>Accompanied him often to the Court of the South
Wind.
<br>When the spirit left great statesmen, on walls of the
Hall of  Fame
<br>The point of your brush preserved their living
faces.
<br>You crowned all the premiers with coronets of
office;
<br>You fitted all commanders with arrows at their
girdles;
<br>You made the founders of this dynasty, with every hair
alive,
<br>Seem to be just back from the fierceness of a
battle.
<br>...The late Emperor had a horse, known as Jade
Flower,
<br>Whom artists had copied in various poses. <br>They
led him
one day to the red marble stairs <br>With his eyes
toward the
palace in the deepening air.
<br>Then, General, commanded to proceed with your
work,
<br>You centred all your being on a piece of silk.
<br>And
later, when your dragon-horse, born of the sky,
<br>Had banished earthly horses for ten thousand
generations,
<br>There was one Jade Flower standing on the dais
<br>And
another by the steps, and they marvelled at each
other....
<br>The Emperor rewarded you with smiles and with
gifts,
<br>While officers and men of the stud hung about and
stared.
<br>...Han Gan, your follower, has likewise grown
proficient
<br>At representing horses in all their attitudes;
<br>But
picturing the flesh, he fails to draw the bone-
<br>So that even the finest are deprived of their
spirit.
<br>You, beyond the mere skill, used your art divinely-

<br>And expressed, not only horses, but the life of a good
man....
<br>Yet here you are, wandering in a world of disorder
<br>And
sketching from time to time some petty passerby
<br>People note your case with the whites of their
eyes.
<br>There's nobody purer, there's nobody poorer.
<br>...Read in
the records, from earliest times, <br>How hard it is
to be a
great artist.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL <br> OF LADY GONGSUN</i></b></blockquote>



<br><font size=-1>

  On the 19th of the Tenth-month in the second year of
Dali, I saw, in the house of the Kueifu official Yuante,
a girl
named Li from Lingying dancing with a dagger. I admired
her skill
and asked who was her teacher. She named Lady Gongsun. I
remembered that in the third year of Kaiyuan at Yancheng,
when I
was a little boy, I saw Lady Gongsun dance. She was the
only one
in the Imperial Theatre who could dance with this weapon.
Now she
is aged and unknown, and even her pupil has passed the
heyday of
beauty. I wrote this poem to express my wistfulness.
The work
of Zhang Xu of the Wu district, that great  master of
grassy
writing, was improved by his having been present  when
Lady
Gongsun danced in the Yeh district. From this may be
judged the
art of Gongsun.

</a></center></font>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,
<br>Who,
dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters
<br>An audience like mountains lost among themselves.
<br>Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her
motions,
<br>Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine
suns down
the sky
<br>And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons.
<br>She
began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger, <br>And
ended
like the shining calm of rivers and the
sea....
<br>But vanished are those red lips and those pearly
sleeves;
<br>And none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her
fame,
<br>This beauty from Lingying, at the Town of the White
God,
<br>Dancing still and singing in the old blithe way.
<br>And
while we reply to each other's questions, <br>We sigh
together, saddened by changes that have come.
<br>There were eight thousand ladies in the late Emperor's
court,
<br>But none could dance the dagger-dance like Lady
Gongsun.
<br>...Fifty years have passed, like the turning of a
palm;
<br>Wind and dust, filling the world, obscure the Imperial
House.
<br>Instead of the Pear-Garden Players, who have blown by
like a
mist,
<br>There are one or two girl-musicians now-trying to
charm the
cold Sun.
<br>There are man-size trees by the Emperor's Golden
Tomb
<br>I seem to hear dead grasses rattling on the cliffs of
Qutang.
<br>...The song is done, the slow string and quick pipe
have
ceased.
<br>At the height of joy, sorrow comes with the eastern
moon
rising.
<br>And I, a poor old man, not knowing where to go,
<br>Must
harden my feet on the lone hills, toward sickness and
despair.

<blockquote><b><i>MOUNTAIN-STONES</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>Rough were the mountain-stones, and the path very
narrow;
<br>And when I reached the temple, bats were in the
dusk.
<br>I climbed to the hall, sat on the steps, and drank the
rain-
washed air
<br>Among the round gardenia-pods and huge
bananaleaves.
<br>On the old wall, said the priest, were Buddhas finely
painted,
<br>And he brought a light and showed me, and I called
them
wonderful
<br>He spread the bed, dusted the mats, and made my supper
ready,
<br>And, though the food was coarse, it satisfied my
hunger.
<br>At midnight, while I lay there not hearing even an
insect,
<br>The mountain moon with her pure light entered my
door....
<br>At dawn I left the mountain and, alone, lost my
way:
<br>In and out, up and down, while a heavy mist
<br>Made brook
and mountain green and purple, brightening
everything.
<br>I am passing sometimes pines and oaks, which ten men
could not
girdle,
<br>I am treading pebbles barefoot in swift-running water
 --
<br>Its ripples purify my ear, while a soft wind blows my
garments....
<br>These are the things which, in themselves, make life
happy.
<br>Why should we be hemmed about and hampered with
people?
<br>O chosen pupils, far behind me in my own country,
<br>What
if I spent my old age here and never went back home?

<blockquote><b><i>ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON <br> TO SUB-OFFICIAL ZHANG</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>The fine clouds have opened and the River of Stars is
gone,
<br>A clear wind blows across the sky, and the moon widens
its
wave,
<br>The sand is smooth, the water still, no sound and no
shadow,
<br>As I offer you a cup of wine, asking you to sing.
<br>But
so sad is this song of yours and so bitter your voice
<br>That before I finish listening my tears have become a
rain:
<br>"Where Lake Dongting is joined to the sky by the lofty
Nine-Doubt Mountain,
<br>Dragons, crocodiles, rise and sink, apes, flying
foxes,
whimper....
<br>At a ten to one risk of death, I have reached my
official
post,
<br>Where lonely I live and hushed, as though I were in
hiding.
<br>I leave my bed, afraid of snakes; I eat, fearing
poisons;
<br>The air of the lake is putrid, breathing its evil
odours....
<br>Yesterday, by the district office, the great drum was
announcing
<br>The crowning of an emperor, a change in the realm.
<br>The
edict granting pardons runs three hundred miles a
day,
<br>All those who were to die have had their sentences
commuted,
<br>The unseated are promoted and exiles are recalled,
<br>Corruptions are abolished, clean officers
appointed.
<br>My superior sent my name in but the governor would not
listen
<br>And has only transferred me to this barbaric
place.
<br>My rank is very low and useless to refer to;
<br>They might
punish me with lashes in the dust of the street.
<br>Most of my fellow exiles are now returning home --
<br>A
journey which, to me, is a heaven beyond climbing."
<br>...Stop your song, I beg you, and listen to mine,
<br>A
song that is utterly different from yours:
<br>"Tonight is the
loveliest moon of the year. <br>All else is with fate,
not
ours to control; <br>But, refusing this wine, may we
choose
more tomorrow?"

<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>The five Holy Mountains have the rank of the Three
Dukes.
<br>The other four make a ring, with the Song Mountain
midmost.
<br>To this one, in the fire-ruled south, where evil signs
are
rife,
<br>Heaven gave divine power, ordaining it a peer.
<br>All the
clouds and hazes are hidden in its girdle; <br>And its
forehead is beholden only by a few. <br>...I came here
in
autumn, during the rainy season, <br>When the sky was
overcast
and the clear wind gone. <br>I quieted my mind and
prayed,
hoping for an answer;
<br>For assuredly righteous thinking reaches to high
heaven.
<br>And soon all the mountain-peaks were showing me their
faces;
<br>I looked up at a pinnacle that held the clean blue
sky:
<br>The wide Purple-Canopy joined the Celestial
Column;
<br>The Stone Granary leapt, while the Fire God stood
still.
<br>Moved by this token, I dismounted to offer thanks.
<br>A
long path of pine and cypress led to the temple.
<br>Its white
walls and purple pillars shone, and the vivid colour
<br>Of gods and devils filled the place with patterns of
red and
blue.
<br>I climbed the steps and, bending down to sacrifice,
besought
<br>That my pure heart might be welcome, in spite of my
humble
offering.
<br>The old priest professed to know the judgment of the
God:
<br>He was polite and reverent, making many bows.
<br>He
handed me divinity-cups, he showed me how to use them
<br>And told me that my fortune was the very best of
all.
<br>Though exiled to a barbarous land, mine is a happy
life.
<br>Plain food and plain clothes are all I ever
wanted.
<br>To be prince, duke, premier, general, was never my
desire;
<br>And if the God would bless me, what better could he
grant
than this ? --
<br>At night I lie down to sleep in the top of a high
tower;
<br>While moon and stars glimmer through the darkness of
the
clouds....
<br>Apes call, a bell sounds. And ready for dawn <br>I
see
arise, far in the east the cold bright sun.

<blockquote><b><i>A POEM ON THE STONE DRUMS</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>Chang handed me this tracing, from the stone
drums,
<br>Beseeching me to write a poem on the stone drums.
<br>Du
Fu has gone. Li Bai is dead.
<br>What can my poor talent do for the stone drums?
<br>...When the Zhou power waned and China was
bubbling,
<br>Emperor Xuan, up in wrath, waved his holy spear:
<br>And
opened his Great Audience, receiving all the tributes
<br>Of kings and lords who came to him with a tune of
clanging
weapons.
<br>They held a hunt in Qiyang and proved their
marksmanship:
<br>Fallen birds and animals were strewn three thousand
miles.
<br>And the exploit was recorded, to inform new
generations....
<br>Cut out of jutting cliffs, these drums made of stone-

<br>On which poets and artisans, all of the first
order,
<br>Had indited and chiselled-were set in the deep
mountains
<br>To be washed by rain, baked by sun, burned by
wildfire,
<br>Eyed by evil spirits; and protected by the gods.
<br>...Where can he have found the tracing on this paper?
 --
<br>True to the original, not altered by a hair,
<br>The
meaning deep, the phrases cryptic, difficult to read.
<br>And the style of the characters neither square nor
tadpole.
<br>Time has not yet vanquished the beauty of these
letters --
<br>Looking like sharp daggers that pierce live
crocodiles,
<br>Like phoenix-mates dancing, like angels hovering
down,
<br>Like trees of jade and coral with interlocking
branches,
<br>Like golden cord and iron chain tied together
tight,
<br>Like incense-tripods flung in the sea, like dragons
mounting
heaven.
<br>Historians, gathering ancient poems, forgot to gather
these,
<br>To make the two Books of Musical Song more colourful
and
striking;
<br>Confucius journeyed in the west, but not to the Qin
Kingdom,
<br>He chose our planet and our stars but missed the sun
and
moon
<br>I who am fond of antiquity, was born too late
<br>And,
thinking of these wonderful things, cannot hold back my
tears....
<br>I remember, when I was awarded my highest degree,
<br>During the first year of Yuanho,
<br>How a friend of mine, then at the western camp,
<br>Offered
to assist me in removing these old relics. <br>I
bathed and
changed, then made my plea to the college president
<br>And urged on him the rareness of these most precious
things.
<br>They could be wrapped in rugs, be packed and sent in
boxes
<br>And carried on only a few camels: ten stone drums
<br>To
grace the Imperial Temple like the Incense-Pot of Gao --

<br>Or their lustre and their value would increase a
hundredfold,
<br>If the monarch would present them to the
university,
<br>Where students could study them and doubtless decipher
them,
<br>And multitudes, attracted to the capital of
culture
<br>Prom all corners of the Empire, would be quick to
gather.
<br>We could scour the moss, pick out the dirt, restore
the
original surface,
<br>And lodge them in a fitting and secure place for
ever,
<br>Covered by a massive building with wide eaves
<br>Where
nothing more might happen to them as it had before.
<br>...But government officials grow fixed in their
ways
<br>And never will initiate beyond old precedent;
<br>So herd-
boys strike the drums for fire, cows polish horns on
them,
<br>With no one to handle them reverentially. <br>Still
ageing
and decaying, soon they may be effaced.
<br>Six years I have sighed for them, chanting toward the
west....
<br>The familiar script of Wang Xizhi, beautiful though it
was,
<br>Could be had, several pages, just for a few white
geese,
<br>But now, eight dynasties after the Zhou, and all the
wars
over,
<br>Why should there be nobody caring for these drums?
<br>The
Empire is at peace, the government free. <br>Poets
again are
honoured and Confucians and Mencians....
<br>Oh, how may this petition be carried to the
throne?
<br>It needs indeed an eloquent flow, like a cataract-

<br>But, alas, my voice has broken, in my song of the
stone
drums,
<br>To a sound of supplication choked with its own
tears.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>China's Emperor, craving beauty that might shake an
empire,
<br>Was on the throne for many years, searching, never
finding,
<br>Till a little child of the Yang clan, hardly even
grown,
<br>Bred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her,
<br>But
with graces granted by heaven and not to be
concealed,
<br>At last one day was chosen for the imperial
household.
<br>If she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast
a
hundred spells,
<br>And the powder and paint of the Six Palaces faded into
nothing.
<br>...It was early spring. They bathed her in the
FlowerPure
Pool,
<br>Which warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of
her
skin,
<br>And, because of her languor, a maid was lifting
her
<br>When first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for
his
bride.
<br>The cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold
ripples of her
crown when she moved,
<br>Were sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus
curtains;
<br>But nights of spring were short and the sun arose too
soon,
<br>And the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his
early
hearings
<br>And lavished all his time on her with feasts and
revelry,
<br>His mistress of the spring, his despot of the
night.
<br>There were other ladies in his court, three thousand
of rare
beauty,
<br>But his favours to three thousand were concentered in
one
body.
<br>By the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it
would be
almost evening;
<br>And when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she
would
loiter, slow with wine.
<br>Her sisters and her brothers all were given
titles;
<br>And, because she so illumined and glorified her
clan,
<br>She brought to every father, every mother through the
empire,
<br>Happiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.
<br>...High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,
<br>And far
and wide the breezes carried magical notes <br>Of soft
song
and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.
<br>The Emperor's eyes could never gaze on her enough-

<br>Till war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole
earth
<br>And broke the tunes of <i>The Rainbow Skirt and the
Feathered
Coat</i>.
<br>The Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in
the
dust
<br>From thousands of horses and chariots headed
southwest.
<br>The imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now
pausing-
-
<br>But thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western
gate,
<br>The men of the army stopped, not one of them would
stir
<br>Till under their horses' hoofs they might trample
those moth-
eyebrows....
<br>Flowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked
them
up,
<br>And a  green and white jade hair-tassel and a
yellowgold hair-
bird.
<br>The Emperor could not save her, he could only cover
his
face.
<br>And later when he turned to look, the place of blood
and
tears
<br>Was hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.
<br>...
At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed
through
a cloud-line
<br>Under Omei Mountain. The last few came.
<br>Flags and banners lost their colour in the fading
sunlight....
<br>But as waters of Shu are always green and its
mountains always
blue,
<br>So changeless was His Majesty's love and deeper than
the
days.
<br>He stared at the desolate moon from his temporary
palace.
<br>He heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at
his
breast.
<br>And when heaven and earth resumed their round and the
dragon
car faced home,
<br>The Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn
away
<br>From the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was
buried
<br>That memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white
face?
<br>Ruler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their
coats
<br>As they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back
to the capital.
<br>...The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just
as
before,
<br>The Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace
willows;
<br>But a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her
eyebrow --

<br>And what could he do but cry whenever he looked at
them?
<br>...Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds
of
spring;
<br>Lakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn
rains;
<br>The Western and Southern Palaces were littered with
late
grasses,
<br>And the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one
swept
away.
<br>Her Pear-Garden Players became white-haired <br>And
the
eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;
<br>Over the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in
the
twilight.
<br>He would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still
could
never sleep.
<br>Bell and drum would slowly toll the dragging
nighthours
<br>And the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just
before
dawn,
<br>And the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow
thick with
morning frost
<br>And his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and
colder
<br>With the distance between life and death year after
year;
<br>And yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.
<br>...At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest
of
heaven,
<br>Able to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.
<br>And
people were so moved by the Emperor's constant
brooding
<br>That they besought the Taoist priest to see if he
could find
her.
<br>He opened his way in space and clove the ether like
lightning,
<br>Up to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.
<br>Above, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow
Spring;
<br>But he failed, in either place, to find the one he
looked
for.
<br>And then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at
sea,
<br>A part of the intangible and incorporeal world,
<br>With
pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,
<br>And of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,
<br>And of
one among them-whom they called The Ever True-
<br>With a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he
sought.
<br>So he went to the West Hall's gate of gold and knocked
at the
jasper door
<br>And asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The
Doubly-
Perfect.
<br>And the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of
China,
<br>Was startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered,
canopy.
<br>She pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away
sleep,
<br>And opened the pearly shade and then the silver
screen.
<br>Her cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her
great
haste,
<br>And her flower-cap was loose when she came along the
terrace,
<br>While a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with
her
motion
<br>As though she danced <i>The Rainbow Skirt and the
Feathered
Coat</i>.
<br>And the tear-drops drifting down her sad white
face
<br>Were like a rain in spring on the blossom of the
pear.
<br>But love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him
thank
her liege,
<br>Whose form and voice had been strange to her ever
since their
parting --
<br>Since happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright
Sun,
<br>And moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain
Palace.
<br>But when she turned her face and looked down toward
the
earth
<br>And tried to see the capital, there were only fog and
dust.
<br>So she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had
given
<br>And, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and
gold
hairpin,
<br>But kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the
box,
<br>Breaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell
of the
box;
<br>"Our souls belong together," she said, " like this
gold and
this shell --
<br>Somewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall
surely
<br>And she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence
reminding
him
<br>Of vows which had been known only to their two
hearts:
<br>"On  the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the
Palace of
Long Life,
<br>We told each other secretly in the quiet midnight
world
<br>That we wished to fly in heaven, two birds  with the
wings of
one,
<br>And to grow together on the earth, two branches of one
tree."
<br>Earth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall
end,
<br>While this unending sorrow goes on and on for
ever.

<blockquote><b><i>THE SONG OF A GUITAR</i></b></blockquote>





<br><font size=-1>
In the tenth year of Yuanhe I was banished and demoted to
be
assistant official in Jiujiang. In the summer of the next
year
I was seeing a friend leave Penpu  and heard in the
midnight
from a neighbouring boat a guitar played in the manner of
the
capital. Upon inquiry, I found  that the player had
formerly been
a
dancing-girl there and in her maturity had been  married
to a
merchant. I invited her to my boat to have her play for
us. She
told
me her story, heyday and then unhappiness. Since my
departure
from the capital I had not felt sad; but that night,
after I left
her, I began to realize my banishment. And I wrote this
long poem
 -- six hundred and twelve characters.
</a></center></font>


<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>I was bidding a guest farewell, at night on the
Xunyang
River,
<br>Where maple-leaves and full-grown rushes rustled in
the
autumn.
<br>I, the host, had dismounted, my guest had boarded his
boat,
<br>And we raised our cups and wished to drink-but, alas,
there
was no music.
<br>For all we had drunk we felt no joy and were parting
from each
other,
<br>When the river widened mysteriously toward the full
moon --

<br>We had heard a sudden sound, a guitar across the
water.
<br>Host forgot to turn back home, and guest to go his
way.
<br>We followed where the melody led and asked the
player's
name.
<br>The sound broke off...then reluctantly she
answered.
<br>We moved our boat near hers, invited her to join
us,
<br>Summoned more wine and lanterns to recommence our
banquet.
<br>Yet we called and urged a thousand times before she
started
toward us,
<br>Still hiding half her face from us behind her
guitar.
<br>...She turned the tuning-pegs and tested several
strings;
<br>We could feel what she was feeling, even before she
played:
<br>Each string a meditation, each note a deep
thought,
<br>As if she were telling us the ache of her whole
life.
<br>She knit her brows, flexed her fingers, then began her
music,
<br>Little by little letting her heart share everything
with
ours.
<br>She brushed the strings, twisted them slow, swept
them,
plucked them --
<br>First the air of <i>The Rainbow Skirt</i>, then <i>The
Six
Little Ones</i>.
<br>The large strings hummed like rain,
<br>The small strings whispered like a secret,
<br>Hummed,
whispered-and then were intermingled <br>Like a
pouring of
large and small pearls into a plate of jade.
<br>We heard an oriole, liquid, hidden among flowers.
<br>We
heard a brook bitterly sob along a bank of sand...
<br>By the checking of its cold touch, the very string
seemed
broken
<br>As though it could not pass; and the notes, dying
away
<br>Into a depth of sorrow and concealment of lament,
<br>Told
even more in silence than they had told in sound....
<br>A silver vase abruptly broke with a gush of water,
<br>And out leapt armored horses and weapons that clashed
and
smote --
<br>And, before she laid her pick down, she ended with one
stroke,
<br>And all four strings made one sound, as of rending
silk
<br>There was quiet in the east boat and quiet in the
west,
<br>And we saw the white autumnal moon enter the river's
heart.
<br>...When she had slowly placed the pick back among the
strings,
<br>She rose and smoothed her clothing and, formal,
courteous,
<br>Told us how she had spent her girlhood at the
capital,
<br>Living in her parents' house under the Mount of
Toads,
<br>And had mastered the guitar at the age of
thirteen,
<br>With her name recorded first in the class-roll of
musicians,
<br>Her art the admiration even of experts,
<br>Her beauty the envy of all the leading dancers,
<br>How
noble youths of Wuling had lavishly competed <br>And
numberless red rolls of silk been given for one song,
<br>And silver combs with shell inlay been snapped by her
rhythms,
<br>And skirts the colour of blood been spoiled with
stains of
wine....
<br>Season after season, joy had followed joy,
<br>Autumn moons
and spring winds had passed without her heeding,
<br>Till first her brother left for the war, and then her
aunt
died,
<br>And evenings went and evenings came, and her beauty
faded --

<br>With ever fewer chariots and horses at her door;
<br>So
that finally she gave herself as wife to a merchant
<br>Who, prizing money first, careless how he left
her,
<br>Had gone, a month before, to Fuliang to buy tea.
<br>And
she had been tending an empty boat at the river's
mouth,
<br>No company but the bright moon and the cold water.
<br>And
sometimes in the deep of night she would dream of her
triumphs
<br>And be wakened from her dreams by the scalding of her
tears.
<br>Her very first guitar-note had started me sighing;
<br>Now,
having heard her story, I was sadder still. <br>"We
are both
unhappy -- to the sky's end.
<br>We meet. We understand. What does acquaintance
matter?
<br>I came, a year ago, away from the capital <br>And
am now
a sick exile here in Jiujiang -- <br>And so remote is
Jiujiang that I have heard no music,
<br>Neither string nor bamboo, for a whole year. <br>My
quarters, near the River Town, are low and damp,
<br>With bitter reeds and yellowed rushes all about the
house.
<br>And what is to be heard here, morning and evening? --

<br>The bleeding cry of cuckoos, the whimpering of
apes.
<br>On flowery spring mornings and moonlit autumn
nights
<br>I have often taken wine up and drunk it all alone,
<br>Of
course there are the mountain songs and the village
pipes,
<br>But they are crude and-strident, and grate on my
ears.
<br>And tonight, when I heard you playing your guitar,
<br>I
felt as if my hearing were bright with fairymusic.
<br>Do not leave us. Come, sit down. Play for us
again.
<br>And I will write a long song concerning a guitar."
<br>...Moved by what I said, she stood there for a
moment,
<br>Then sat again to her strings-and they sounded even
sadder,
<br>Although the tunes were different from those she had
played
before....
<br>The feasters, all listening, covered their faces.
<br>But
who of them all was crying the most?
<br>This Jiujiang official. My blue sleeve was wet.

<blockquote>Li Shangyin</blockquote>
<blockquote><b><i>THE HAN MONUMENT</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>The Son of Heaven in Yuanhe times was martial as a
god
<br>And might be likened only to the Emperors Xuan and
Xi.
<br>He took an oath to reassert the glory of the
empire,
<br>And tribute was brought to his palace from all four
quarters.
<br>Western Huai for fifty years had been a bandit
country,
<br>Wolves becoming lynxes, lynxes becoming bears.
<br>They
assailed the mountains and rivers, rising from the
plains,
<br>With their long spears and sharp lances aimed at the
Sun.
<br>But the Emperor had a wise premier, by the name of
Du,
<br>Who, guarded by spirits against assassination,
<br>Hong
at his girdle the seal of state, and accepted chief
command,
<br>While these savage winds were harrying the flags of
the
Ruler of Heaven.
<br>Generals Suo, Wu, Gu, and Tong became his paws and
claws;
<br>Civil and military experts brought their
writingbrushes,
<br>And his recording adviser was wise and resolute.
<br>A hundred and forty thousand soldiers, fighting like
lions
and tigers,
<br>Captured the bandit chieftains for the Imperial
Temple.
<br>So complete a victory was a supreme event; <br>And
the
Emperor said: "To you, Du, should go the highest
honour,
<br>And your secretary, Yu, should write a record of
it."
<br>When Yu had bowed his head, he leapt and danced,
saying:
<br>"Historical writings on stone and metal are my
especial
art;
<br>And, since I know the finest brush-work of the old
masters,
<br>My duty in this instance is more than merely
official,
<br>And I should be at fault if I modestly declined."
<br>The
Emperor, on hearing this, nodded many times. <br>And
Yu retired
and fasted and, in a narrow workroom,
<br>His great brush thick with ink as with drops of
rain,
<br>Chose characters like those in the Canons of Yao and
Xun,
<br>And a style as in the ancient poems Qingmiao and
Shengmin.
<br>And soon the description was ready, on a sheet of
paper.
<br>In the morning he laid it, with a bow, on the purple
stairs.
<br>He memorialized the throne: "I, unworthy,
<br>Have dared to record this exploit, for a
monument."
<br>The tablet was thirty feet high, the characters large
as
dippers;
<br>It was set on a sacred tortoise, its columns flanked
with
ragons....
<br>The phrases were strange with deep words that few
could
understand;
<br>And jealousy entered and malice and reached the
Emperor --
<br>So that a rope a hundred feet long pulled the tablet
down
<br>And coarse sand and small stones ground away its
face.
<br>But literature endures, like the universal spirit,
<br>And
its breath becomes a part of the vitals of all men.
<br>The Tang plate, the Confucian tripod, are eternal
things,
<br>Not because of their forms, but because of their
inscriptions....
<br>Sagacious is our sovereign and wise his minister,
<br>And
high their successes and prosperous their reign;
<br>But unless it be recorded by a writing such as
this,
<br>How may they hope to rival the three and five good
rulers?
<br>I wish I could write ten thousand copies to read ten
thousand
times,
<br>Till spittle ran from my lips and calluses hardened my
fingers,
<br>And still could hand them down, through seventy-two
generations,
<br>As corner-stones for Rooms of Great Deeds on the
Sacred
Mountains.

<br><font size=-1>
  In the sixth year of Kaiyuan, a friend returned
from the border and showed me the Yan Song. Moved  by
what he
told me of the expedition, I have written this poem to
the same
rhymes.
</a></center></font>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<br>The northeastern border of China was dark with smoke
and
dust.
<br>To repel the savage invaders, our generals, leaving
their
families,
<br>Strode forth together, looking as heroes should
look;
<br>And having received from the Emperor his most gracious
favour,
<br>They marched to the beat of gong and drum through the
Elm
Pass.
<br>They circled the Stone Tablet with a line of waving
flags,
<br>Till their captains over the Sea of Sand were twanging
feathered orders.
<br>The Tartar chieftain's hunting-fires glimmered along
Wolf
Mountain,
<br>And heights and rivers were cold and bleak there at
the outer
border;
<br>But soon the barbarians' horses were plunging through
wind and
rain.
<br>Half of our men at the front were killed, but the
other half
are living,
<br>And still at the camp beautiful girls dance for them
and
sing.
<br>...As autumn ends in the grey sand, with the grasses
all
withered,
<br>The few surviving watchers by the lonely wall at
sunset,
<br>Serving in a good cause, hold life and the foeman
lightly.
<br>And yet, for all that they have done, Elm Pass is
still
unsafe.
<br>Still at the front, iron armour is worn and battered
thin,
<br>And here at home food-sticks are made of jade
tears.
<br>Still in this southern city young wives' hearts are
breaking,
<br>While soldiers at the northern border vainly look
toward
home.
<br>The fury of the wind cuts our men's advance <br>In
a place
of death and blue void, with nothingness ahead.
<br>Three times a day a cloud of slaughter rises over the
camp;
<br>And all night long the hour-drums shake their chilly
booming,
<br>Until white swords can be seen again, spattered with
red
blood.
<br>...When death becomes a duty, who stops to think of
fame?
<br>Yet in speaking of the rigours of warfare on the
desert
<br>We name to this day Li, the great General, who lived
long
ago.
