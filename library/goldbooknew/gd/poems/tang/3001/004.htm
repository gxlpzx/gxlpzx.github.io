<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>Through the bright day up the mountain, we scan the
sky for a
war-torch;
<br>At yellow dusk we water our horses in the
boundaryriver;
<br>And when the throb of watch-drums hangs in the sandy
wind,
<br>We hear the guitar of the Chinese Princess telling her
endless
woe....
<br>Three thousand miles without a town, nothing but
camps,
<br>Till the heavy sky joins the wide desert in snow.
<br>With
their plaintive calls, barbarian wildgeese fly from night
to
night,
<br>And children of the Tartars have many tears to
shed;
<br>But we hear that the Jade Pass is still under
siege,
<br>And soon we stake our lives upon our light
warchariots.
<br>Each year we bury in the desert bones unnumbered,
<br>Yet
we only watch for grape-vines coming into China.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>There's a girl from Loyang in the door across the
street,
<br>She looks fifteen, she may be a little older.
<br>...While
her master rides his rapid horse with jade bit an
bridle,
<br>Her handmaid brings her cod-fish in a golden
plate.
<br>On her painted pavilions, facing red towers,
<br>Cornices
are pink and green with peach-bloom and with willow,
<br>Canopies of silk awn her seven-scented chair,
<br>And rare
fans shade her, home to her nine-flowered curtains.
<br>Her lord, with rank and wealth and in the bud of
life,
<br>Exceeds in munificence the richest men of old.
<br>He
favours this girl of lowly birth, he has her taught to
dance;
<br>And he gives away his coral-trees to almost
anyone.
<br>The wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights
go
out,
<br>Those nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain
of
flowers.
<br>Between dances she has barely time for singing over
the
songs;
<br>No sooner is she dressed again than incense burns
before
her.
<br>Those she knows in town are only the rich and the
lavish,
<br>And day and night she is visiting the hosts of the
gayest
mansions.
<br>...Who notices the girl from Yue with a face of white
jade,
<br>Humble, poor, alone, by the river, washing silk?

<blockquote><b><i>SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>When he was a youth of fifteen or twenty,
<br>He chased a wild horse, he caught him and rode
him,
<br>He shot the white-browed mountain tiger, <br>He
defied
the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye. <br>Fighting
single-
handed for a thousand miles,
<br>With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.
<br>...Granted that the troops of China were as swift as
heaven's
thunder
<br>And that Tartar soldiers perished in pitfalls fanged
with
iron,
<br>General Wei Qing's victory was only a thing of
chance.
<br>And General Li Guang's thwarted effort was his fate,
not his
fault.
<br>Since this man's retirement he is looking old and
worn:
<br>Experience of the world has hastened his white
hairs.
<br>Though once his quick dart never missed the right eye
of a
bird,
<br>Now knotted veins and tendons make his left arm like
an
osier.
<br>He is sometimes at the road-side selling melons from
his
garden,
<br>He is sometimes planting willows round his
hermitage.
<br>His lonely lane is shut away by a dense grove,
<br>His
vacant window looks upon the far cold mountains
<br>But, if he prayed, the waters would come gushing for
his
men
<br>And never would he  wanton his cause away with
wine.
<br>...War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan
Range;
<br>Back and forth, day and night, go feathered
messages;
<br>In the three River Provinces, the governors call young
men --

<br>And five imperial edicts have summoned the old
general.
<br>So he dusts his iron coat and shines it like snow-

<br>Waves his dagger from its jade hilt in a dance of
starry
steel.
<br>He is ready with his strong northern bow to smite the
Tartar
chieftain --
<br>That never a foreign war-dress may affront the
Emperor.
<br>...There once was an aged Prefect, forgotten and far
away,
<br>Who still could manage triumph with a single
stroke.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>A fisherman is drifting, enjoying the spring
mountains,
<br>And the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an
ancient
source.
<br>Watching the fresh-coloured trees, he never thinks of
distance
<br>Till he comes to the end of the blue stream and
suddenly-
strange men!
<br>It's a cave-with a mouth so narrow that he has to
crawl
through;
<br>But then it opens wide again on a broad and level path
 --
<br>And far beyond he faces clouds crowning a reach of
trees,
<br>And thousands of houses shadowed round with flowers
and
bamboos....
<br>Woodsmen tell him their names in the ancient speech of
Han;
<br>And clothes of  the Qin Dynasty are worn by all these
people
<br>Living on the uplands, above the Wuling River,
<br>On farms
and in gardens that are like a world apart,
<br>Their dwellings at peace under pines in the clear
moon,
<br>Until sunrise fills the low sky with crowing and
barking.
<br>...At news of a stranger the people all assemble,
<br>And
each of them invites him home and asks him where he was
born.
<br>Alleys and paths are cleared for him of petals in the
morning,
<br>And fishermen and farmers bring him their loads at
dusk....
<br>They had left the world long ago, they had come here
seeking
refuge;
<br>They have lived like angels ever since, blessedly far
away,
<br>No one in the cave knowing anything outside,
<br>Outsiders
viewing only empty mountains and thick clouds.
<br>...The fisherman, unaware of his great good
fortune,
<br>Begins to think of country, of home, of worldly
ties,
<br>Finds his way out of the cave again, past mountains
and past
rivers,
<br>Intending some time to return, when he has told his
kin.
<br>He studies every step he takes, fixes it well in
mind,
<br>And forgets that cliffs and peaks may vary their
appearance.
<br>...It is certain that to enter through the deepness of
the
mountain,
<br>A green river leads you, into a misty wood. <br>But
now,
with spring-floods everywhere and floating peachpetals --

<br>Which is the way to go, to find that hidden
source?

  <blockquote><b><i>HARD ROADS IN SHU</i></b></blockquote>


  <blockquote><blockquote>

  <br>Oh, but it is high and very dangerous!
  <br>Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue
  sky.
  <br>...Until two rulers of this region
  <br>Pushed their way through in the misty ages,
  <br>Forty-eight thousand years had passed
  <br>With nobody arriving across the Qin border.
<br>And the Great White Mountain, westward, still has only
a
bird's path
<br>Up to the summit of Emei Peak --
<br>Which was broken once by an earthquake and there were
brave
men lost,
<br>Just finishing the stone rungs of their ladder toward
heaven.
<br>...High, as on a tall flag, six dragons drive the
sun,
<br>While the river, far below, lashes its twisted
course.
<br>Such height would be hard going for even a yellow
crane,
<br>So pity the poor monkeys who have only paws to
use.
<br>The Mountain of Green Clay is formed of many circles-

<br>Each hundred steps, we have to turn nine turns among
its mound
 --
<br>Panting, we brush Orion and pass the Well Star,
<br>Then,
holding our chests with our hands and sinking to the
ground with
a groan,
<br>We wonder if this westward trail will never have an
end.
<br>The formidable path ahead grows darker, darker
still,
<br>With nothing heard but the call of birds hemmed in by
the
ancient forest,
<br>Male birds smoothly wheeling, following the
females;
<br>And there come to us the melancholy voices of the
cuckoos
<br>Out on the empty mountain, under the lonely
moon....
<br>Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue
sky.
<br>Even to hear of it turns the cheek pale,
<br>With the highest crag barely a foot below heaven.
<br>Dry
pines hang, head down, from the face of the cliffs,
<br>And a thousand plunging cataracts outroar one
another
<br>And send through ten thousand valleys a thunder of
spinning
stones.
<br>With all this danger upon danger,
<br>Why do people come here who live at a safe
distance?
<br>...Though Dagger-Tower Pass be firm and grim,
<br>And
while one man guards it
<br>Ten thousand cannot force it,
<br>What if he be not loyal,
<br>But a wolf toward his fellows?
<br>...There are ravenous tigers to fear in the day
<br>And
venomous reptiles in the night
<br>With their teeth and their fangs ready
<br>To cut people down like hemp.
<br>Though the City of Silk be delectable, I would rather
turn
home quickly.
<br>Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue
sky....
<br>But I still face westward with a dreary moan.

  <blockquote><b><i>BRINGING IN THE WINE</i></b></blockquote>


  <blockquote><blockquote>

  <br>See how the Yellow River's waters move out of
  heaven.
  <br>Entering the ocean, never to return.
  <br>See how lovely locks in bright mirrors in high
  chambers,
<br>Though silken-black at morning, have changed by night
to
snow.
<br>...Oh, let a man of spirit venture where he
pleases
<br>And never tip his golden cup empty toward the
moon!
<br>Since heaven gave the talent, let it be employed!
<br>Spin
a thousand pieces of silver, all of them come back!
<br>Cook a sheep, kill a cow, whet the appetite,
<br>And make
me, of three hundred bowls, one long drink!
<br>...To the old master, Cen,
<br>And the young scholar, Danqiu,
<br>Bring in the wine!
<br>Let your cups never rest!
<br>Let me sing you a song!
<br>Let your ears attend!
<br>What are bell and drum, rare dishes and treasure?
<br>Let
me be forever drunk and never come to reason!
<br>Sober men
of olden days and sages are forgotten, <br>And only
the great
drinkers are famous for all time.
<br>...Prince Chen paid at a banquet in the Palace of
Perfection
<br>Ten thousand coins for a cask of wine, with many a
laugh and
quip.
<br>Why say, my host, that your money is gone? <br>Go
and buy
wine and we'll drink it together!
<br>My flower-dappled horse,
<br>My furs worth a thousand,
<br>Hand them to the boy to exchange for good wine,
<br>And
we'll drown away the woes of ten thousand
generations!

  <br>车辚辚，
  马萧萧，
  <br>行人弓箭各在腰。
  <br>耶娘妻子走相送，
  尘埃不见咸阳桥。
  <br>牵衣顿足拦道哭，
  哭声直上干云霄。
  <br>道旁过者问行人，
  行人但云点行频。
  <br>或从十五北防河，
  便至四十西营田。
  <br>去时里正与裹头，
  归来头白还戍边。
  <br>边亭流血成海水，
  武皇开边意未已。
  <br>君不闻，
  汉家山东二百州，
  <br>千村万落生荆杞？
  <br>纵有健妇把锄犁，
  禾生陇亩无东西。
  <br>况复秦兵耐苦战，
  被驱不异犬与鸡。
  <br>长者虽有问，
  役夫敢申恨；
  <br>且如今年冬，
  未休关西卒。
  <br>县官急索租，
  租税从何出？
  <br>信知生男恶，
  反是生女好；
  <br>生女犹得嫁比邻，
  生男埋没随百草。
  <br>君不见，
  青海头，
  <br>古来白骨无人收？
  <br>新鬼烦冤旧鬼哭，
  天阴雨湿声啾啾。

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF WAR-CHARIOTS</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>The war-chariots rattle,
<br>The war-horses whinny.
<br>Each man of you has a bow and a quiver at his
belt.
<br>Father, mother, son, wife, stare at you going,
<br>Till
dust shall have buried the bridge beyond Changan.
<br>They run with you, crying, they tug at your
sleeves,
<br>And the sound of their sorrow goes up to the
clouds;
<br>And every time a bystander asks you a question,
<br>You can
only say to him that you have to go. <br>...We
remember others
at fifteen sent north to guard the river
<br>And at forty sent west to cultivate the campfarms.
<br>The mayor wound their turbans for them when they
started
out.
<br>With their turbaned hair white now, they are still at
the
border,
<br>At the border where the blood of men spills like the
sea --

<br>And still the heart of Emperor Wu is beating for
war.
<br>...Do you know that, east of China's mountains, in two
hundred
districts
<br>And in thousands of villages, nothing grows but
weeds,
<br>And though strong women have bent to the
ploughing,
<br>East and west the furrows all are broken down?
<br>...Men
of China are able to face the stiffest battle,
<br>But their officers drive them like chickens and
dogs.
<br>Whatever is asked of them,
<br>Dare they complain?
<br>For example, this winter
<br>Held west of the gate,
<br>Challenged for taxes,
<br>How could they pay?
<br>...We have learned that to have a son is bad luck-

<br>It is very much better to have a daughter <br>Who
can
marry and live in the house of a neighbour,
<br>While under the sod we bury our boys.
<br>...Go to the Blue Sea, look along the shore <br>At
all the old white bones forsaken --
<br>New ghosts are wailing there now with the old,
<br>Loudest in the dark sky of a stormy day.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF FAIR WOMEN</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>On the third day of the Third-month in the freshening
weather
<br>Many beauties take the air by the Changan
waterfront,
<br>Receptive, aloof, sweet-mannered, sincere, <br>With
soft
fine skin and well-balanced bone. <br>Their
embroidered silk
robes in the spring sun are gleaming --
<br>With a mass of golden peacocks and silver
unicorns.
<br>And hanging far down from their temples
<br>Are blue leaves of delicate kingfisher feathers.
<br>And
following behind them
<br>Is a pearl-laden train, rhythmic with bearers.
<br>Some of
them are kindred to the Royal House -- <br>The titled
Princesses Guo and Qin.
<br>Red camel-humps are brought them from jade
broilers,
<br>And sweet fish is ordered them on crystal trays.
<br>Though their food-sticks of unicorn-horn are lifted
languidly
<br>And the finely wrought phoenix  carving-knife is very
little used,
<br>Fleet horses from the Yellow Gate, stirring no
dust,
<br>Bring precious dishes constantly from the imperial
kitchen.
<br>...While a solemn sound of flutes and drums invokes
gods  and
spirits,
<br>Guests and courtiers gather, all of high rank;
<br>And
finally, riding slow, a dignified horseman
<br>Dismounts at
the pavilion on an embroidered rug. <br>In a snow of
flying
willow-cotton whitening the duckweed,
<br>Bluebirds find their way with vermilion handkerchiefs
 --
<br>But power can be as hot as flame and burn people's
fingers.
<br>Be wary of the Premier, watch for his frown.

  白马嚼啮黄金勒。
  <br>翻身向天仰射云，
  一箭正坠双飞翼。
  <br>明眸皓齿今何在？
  血污游魂归不得。
  <br>清渭东流剑阁深，

  <br>人生有情泪沾臆，
  江水江花岂终极？

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE RIVER</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>I am only an old woodsman, whispering a sob,
<br>As I steal like a spring-shadow down the Winding
River.
<br>...Since the palaces ashore are sealed by a thousand
gates --

<br>Fine willows, new rushes, for whom are you so
green?
<br>...I remember a cloud of flags that came from the
South
Garden,
<br>And ten thousand colours, heightening one another,
<br>And
the Kingdom's first Lady, from the Palace of the Bright
Sun,
<br>Attendant on the Emperor in his royal chariot,
<br>And the
horsemen before them, each with bow and arrows,
<br>And the snowy horses, champing at bits of yellow
gold,
<br>And an archer, breast skyward, shooting through the
clouds
<br>And felling with one dart a pair of flying birds.
<br>...Where are those perfect eyes, where are those
pearly
teeth?
<br>A blood-stained spirit has no home, has nowhere to
return.
<br>And clear Wei waters running east, through the cleft
on Dagger-
Tower Trail,
<br>Carry neither there nor here any news of her.
<br>People,
compassionate, are wishing with tears <br>That she
were as
eternal as the river and the flowers.
<br>...Mounted Tartars, in the yellow twilight, cloud the
town
with dust.
<br>I am fleeing south, but I linger-gazing northward
toward the
throne.

<blockquote><b><i>A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED</i></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>Along the wall of the Capital a white-headed crow
<br>Flies
to the Gate where Autumn Enters and screams there in the
night,
<br>Then turns again and pecks among the roofs of a tall
mansion
<br>Whose lord, a mighty mandarin, has fled before the
Tartars,
<br>With his golden whip now broken, his nine war-horses
dead
<br>And his own flesh and bone scattered to the
winds....
<br>There's a rare ring of green coral underneath the
vest
<br>Of a Prince at a street-corner, bitterly sobbing,
<br>Who
has to give a false name to anyone who asks him-
<br>Just a poor fellow, hoping for employment.
<br>A hundred days' hiding in grasses and thorns
<br>Show
on his body from head to foot. <br>But, since their
first Emperor, all with hooknoses,
<br>These Dragons look different from ordinary men.
<br>Wolves
are in the palace now and Dragons are lost in the desert
 --
<br>O Prince, be very careful of your most sacred
person!
<br>I dare not address you long, here by the open
road,
<br>Nor even to stand beside you for more than these few
moments.
<br>Last night with the spring-wind there came a smell of
blood;
<br>The old Capital is full of camels from the east.
<br>Our
northern warriors are sound enough of body and of hand --

<br>Oh, why so brave in olden times and so craven now?
<br>Our
Emperor, we hear, has given his son the throne <br>And
the
southern border-chieftains are loyally inclined
<br>And the Huamen and Limian tribes are gathering to
avenge
us.
<br>But still be careful-keep yourself well hidden from
the
dagger.
<br>Unhappy Prince, I beg you, be constantly on guard --

<br>Till power blow to your aid from the Five Imperial
Tombs.
