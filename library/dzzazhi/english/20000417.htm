            The World watched agape Friday as the stock market suffered a history-making collapse that 
            shook professional and armchair investors alike.<br>
            <br>
            Already weary from days of heavy selling, investors panicked after the government released 
            a surprisingly bad inflation report. As prices tumbled, many who bought stocks with 
            borrowed money were forced to sell to repay loans, accelerating the downward spiral.<br>
            <br>
            The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 617.78 points, or 5.6 percent to 10,305.77 - by 
            far its biggest one-day point drop ever. At its lowest point, the Dow was off 722 points.<br>
            <br>
            The Nasdaq composite index, home to the technology stocks whose popularity has evaporated, 
            dropped 355.49, or almost 10 percent, to 3,321.29.</font></td>

            <br>
            China expressed strong dissatisfaction today with CIA disciplinary action taken against 
            several employees in connection with the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and 
            once again rejected U.S. conclusions that human error caused the attack. <br>
            <br>
            Beijing said it was not appeased by Saturday's announcement that the CIA had fired one 
            intelligence officer and reprimanded six managers for errors that the agency said led to 
            the May 7 attack. The blast killed three Chinese citizens, injured 20 others and severely 
            damaged U.S.-China relations.<br>
            <br>
            Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao repeated the Chinese government's demand for a 
            thorough investigation, punishment of those responsible and a satisfactory explanation. 
            &quot;It must be pointed out that the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia has unmistakable 
            symbols, and it is also clearly marked on the U.S. maps,&quot; Zhu said in a statement 
            released by the official New China News Agency. &quot;The U.S. claim that it did not know 
            its exact location does not stand up.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The CIA said an internal investigation concluded that intelligence officers had intended 
            to target a Yugoslav arms supply and procurement building but marked the wrong site. A CIA 
            spokesman said a map being used did not show the numbers of the buildings on the street 
            involved, so an officer used the numbering of buildings on parallel streets to mark what 
            he thought was the arms agency. The error was not discovered in target reviews because 
            U.S. databases had not been updated after the embassy moved from another part of Belgrade 
            in 1996, according to the CIA.</font></td>

            Ending years of deadlock, lawmakers on Friday approved the START II treaty to scrap 
            thousands of U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads, but the government warned it would abandon 
            all arms-control pacts if Washington goes ahead with an anti-missile system.<br>
            <br>
            The swift approval of START II was President Vladimir Putin's first major foreign policy 
            action and underlined his strong authority and the willingness of the new centrist 
            majority in parliament to work with the government.<br>
            <br>
            Putin, who took the unusual step of attending the debate to urge ratification, warned that 
            Moscow would pull out of arms agreements if the United States breaches the 1972 
            Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</font></td>

            Two guys left the bar after a long night of drinking, jumped in&nbsp; the car and started 
            it up. After a couple of minutes, an old man &nbsp; appeared in the passenger window and 
            tapped lightly. The passenger&nbsp; screamed, &quot;Look at the window. There's an old 
            ghost's face there!&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The driver sped up, but the old man's face stayed in the window. The passenger rolled his 
            window down part way and, scared out of his&nbsp; wits, said, &quot;What do you 
            want?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The old man softly replied, &quot;You got any tobacco?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The passenger handed the old man a cigarette and yelled, &quot;Step on&nbsp; it,&quot; to 
            the driver, rolling up the window in terror.<br>
            <br>
            A few minutes later they calmed down and started laughing again.&nbsp; The driver said, 
            &quot;I don't know what happened, but don't worry; the&nbsp; speedometer says we're doing 
            80 now.&quot; All of a sudden there was a&nbsp; light tapping on the window and the old 
            man reappeared.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;There he is again,&quot; the passenger yelled. He rolled down the window&nbsp; and 
            shakily said, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Do you have a light?&quot; the old man quietly asked. The passenger threw a lighter 
            out the window saying, &quot;Step on it!&quot;<br>
            <br>
            They were driving about 100 miles an hour, trying to forget what&nbsp; they had just seen 
            and heard, when all of a sudden there came some&nbsp; more tapping.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Oh my God! He's back!&quot; The passenger rolled down the window and&nbsp; screamed 
            in stark terror, &quot;WHAT NOW?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The old man gently replied, &quot;You want some help getting out of the&nbsp; mud?&quot;</font></td>

            Love is not all: It is not meat nor drink<br>

            Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;<br>
            Yet many a man is making friends with death<br>
            even as I speak, for lack of love alone.<br>
            It well may be that in a difficult hour,<br>
            pinned down by need and moaning for release<br>
            or nagged by want past resolutions power,<br>
            I might be driven to sell you love for peace,<br>
            Or trade the memory of this night for food.<br>
            It may well be. I do not think I would.</strong></font></td>

            <td width="100%"><font size="3">Now to say that I didn't notice him, would be lying. To 
            think of it, how could anyone miss him? <br>
            <br>
            Tall, mocha coloured, great build, and of course that big, beautiful smile he has. His 
            name was Anthony. But at the time of introductions I was involved in a downhill 
            relationship. <br>
            <br>
            Though things were not going good for my present relationship, I'm a totally faithful 
            lady, and would not pursue anything out of friendship. <br>
            <br>
            See, I was at Fort Gordon, GA for school for the army called AIT. I was in class of about 
            14, learning mobile communications. <br>
            <br>
            Being so small, and having to spend long days together, we all naturally became close. 
            Anthony and I chatted, and hung out like everyone else. <br>
            <br>
            But it wasn't until my downhill relationship ended, that we had the chance to see if there 
            was anything worth a more persistent approach. <br>
            <br>
            It wasn't right away, not like a rebound fling. It was like the movies, it just happened 
            so perfectly and naturally. <br>
            <br>
            One weekend on pass, a group of our classmate, including Anthony and I, went to Atlanta. <br>
            <br>
            Anthony and I spent most of our time together. But it was just so neat the way we began to 
            get to know each other. <br>
            <br>
            Like when we all went to Six Flags, and since Anthony and I just happen to like riding the 
            front of rollercoasters, so we just naturally paired off. <br>
            <br>
            We had so much fun together. We complimented each other well. He was so sweet, and could 
            make me smile in a second. <br>
            <br>
            Then the night before we were all to return back to base, we stayed up all night talking 
            on the balcony of the hotel. <br>
            <br>
            And while I was going to get some more ice for our drinks, he just looked at me with this 
            look of intent, and then he leaned forward and ever so softly, kissed me. <br>
            <br>
            My whole body went weak. He just looked at me and gave me this fantastic smile. I knew 
            then I was going to fall for him. <br>
            <br>
            Well, from that moment forward, we began our dance of love. We took things like we had all 
            the time in the world to do them together. <br>
            <br>
            We spent most of our time learning how to be friends, and just to enjoy the moment. I was 
            so happy. But like all things, we didn't' have all the time in the world. <br>
            <br>
            School was almost over, and he would be returning to his home in California for a short 
            break before being shipped off to Korea. Since I was National Guard, I would be returning 
            to my home in Maryland. <br>
            <br>
            With these thoughts in my head, I was thinking that this was going to be the end. He would 
            go his way, and I would go mine. But then he did the most unexpected thing, he invited me 
            home to his parents house. <br>
            <br>
            I was so shocked! I didn't think that he would want to pursue a more serious relationship 
            considering our present situation. <br>
            <br>
            But he did, and I went with him. I spent 15 days in sunny California with him and his 
            charming family. It was the happiest days we had ever had together. <br>
            <br>
            We went to the beach, and Hollywood, and Universal studios. We spent nights spooning in 
            the backyard, counting stars. <br>
            <br>
            But then came the dreaded day. It was time for me to leave. Yet through this whole 
            venture, I knew that I was falling in love with him. I hoped he was too. <br>
            <br>
            We didn't really talk about what was to happened when he left for Korea. It just didn't 
            seem to come up. But then there we were, in the airport terminal, getting ready for our 
            good-byes. <br>
            <br>
            Then was when he told me he really cared about me, and didn't want to lose me. I told him 
            I was falling for him, and that he would never lose me. <br>
            <br>
            He would always have me within he heart, and mind to remind him. I thought that this was 
            it, the last time we would ever be together. <br>
            <br>
            We had 6 months together, and yet even now I realize we wasted moments and time because of 
            fear. <br>
            <br>
            I cried a thousand tears, and even his encouraging smile was saddened, as I walked away 
            from him and onto my plane. <br>
            <br>
            I was not even home for more than 2hrs when he called to see how I was. It was then that 
            we finally talked about where we were to go, if we <br>
            were to go anywhere at all. <br>
            <br>
            To my surprise, he wanted to continue our relationship. I asked him if he was sure of what 
            he was going into. I wanted to make sure he knew the risks that followed this decision. <br>
            <br>
            He said he knew, but he just couldn't let me get away, he cared too much for me. I of 
            course was, very willing to give it a try. <br>
            <br>
            I knew that I could end up losing my heart, and then have it broken; but the risks just 
            seem out-weighed by the chance to remain together. It was then I realized, that I had 
            fallen, but just didn't know it yet. <br>
            <br>
            Since we both wanted to make this work, we agreed to be honest with one another about 
            everything. So over the months that past, we relied on email, and letters and phone calls. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And when holidays past, I sent him care packages, and tokens of my affections. Though we 
            were half a world apart, with each day we grew closer and closer. We were happy. <br>
            <br>
            Then it was about 3 days before Valentine's Day this year, and I had planned to tell him 
            how I felt. <br>
            <br>
            I got up the nerve when he called me, but when I was getting ready to say it to him, he 
            beat me to it. <br>
            <br>
            What a magical day, though we could not hold each other, and caress one another, it was as 
            if I could feel him with me. I was in love, wait I take that back, we were in love. <br>
            <br>
            Then it came time for Anthony's mid-tour leave. He was going to go home for 10 days, just 
            10 days, and I was coming with him. It had been <br>
            six months since I had last seen him. <br>
            <br>
            It was now May, and I couldn't wait to see him. Since the day we planned for me to go to 
            California, I thought about it every day. <br>
            <br>
            But that was nothing new, he was always apart of my daily thoughts. He was my constant 
            thought. <br>
            <br>
            Once again it was that anticipation of the moment of seeing him again. I was worried. I 
            wanted to be perfect when he saw me. <br>
            <br>
            But the moment I saw him at the airport, I didn't care what I looked like, I just wanted 
            to within his arms. <br>
            <br>
            When I saw him walking towards me with his arms extended, I thought to myself, this is the 
            man that I love. <br>
            <br>
            We spent our 10 days together, like we had forever. But we spent every moment like it was 
            our last. <br>
            <br>
            When we left, Anthony to Korea, and I to Maryland, it hurt. I felt my heart sadden. Yes, 
            the first time we left each was awful, but this time it was like I was losing apart of me. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I was. But this time we knew where we wanted to take our relationship, we wanted to be 
            together. There is no other option, not when two people love each other. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Now it's mid June, and we have 154 days until we see each other again. It's a long time. 
            But each day I awake, is a day that I look forward <br>
            to seeing him again. <br>
            <br>
            I love him more today than yesterday, and less than tomorrow. People always ask me how we 
            make it work. <br>
            <br>
            I won't lie, it's not easy. But when you love someone, I mean really love someone, time is 
            just a test. <br>
            <br>
            Are we going to make it, we don't know, but we hope. We don't make any promises, for 
            promises always end in tears. <br>
            <br>
            We just hope for things, and trust in one another. We go day by day, and look forward to 
            the day when we will be together.</font></td>
