Canada’s Education<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Canadian education system encompasses（包括）both publicly-founded（公费）and private schools. Canadian children attend kindergarten for one or two years at the age of four or five on a voluntary basis.All children begin Grade 1 at about six years of age. The school year normally runs from September through to the following June. Secondary schools go up to Grades11, 12, leading to university college or CEGEP studies.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Many Canadian public schools are now accepting international students into their programmes. Publicly-founded schools are managed at the local level by elected school boards. Almost all public schools are co-educational and offer day programmes only. Those schools who are actively recruiting（新招）international students offer ESL programmes and will arrange home stays.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Private schools exist in every province and provide another althernative for families who seek an overseas education for their children .All private schools must be registered with the Ministry of Education in the province and must meet the curriculum（课程）and other standards set by their respective ministries. Families can choose schools that are boys-only, girls-only or co-educational. Some offer full boarding programmes, others are day schools and many both.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Canada has a large selection of universities and university colleges located in every region of the country. In 1663,the Seminary of Quebec（魁北克神学校）became the first institution in what was to become Canada.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first English language institution was the University of New Brunswick which opened its doors to students in 1785. Canada’s universities are internationally known for the quality of their teaching and research. Most Canadian universities are largely publicly founded.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fees for universities differ depending on the province, insititution and programme of study. The university year usually runs from September to May. Some universities are on a semester（半学年）or trimestar（三个学期）system, with some courses offered in the summer.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To qualify for a degree programme at most English-speaking universities, students for whom English is not the first language must first pass an English examination test. The TOEFL is commonly accepted, but Canadian universities may have their own test. In addition may universities will accept the results of other English language assessment（评估）tests.
