                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 22px">Kobe Bryant first  
                  started turning heads on the basketball court when he was in  
                  middle school. His talents dominated the game so much that  
                  high schools from all over the Philadelphia area watched him  
                  grow up. The almost six-foot tall seventh grader definitely  
                  had the make-up and genes for the game, as his dad was former  
                  NBA forward, Joe Bryant. Kobe developed his basketball skills  
                  under the watchful eye of his father, helping his mission to  
                  become a professional basketball player. He worked daily on  
                  his game, watching video, playing in the playgrounds and  
                  listening to his father.  
                  <P>When he entered high school at Lower Marion in  
                  Philadelphia, Kobe was a highly touted recruit. He proved that  
                  he had the skills and work ethic to be a star at the next  
                  level and the scouts noticed this. Kobe didn't let anybody  
                  down either, as he played on the varsity basketball team his  
                  freshman year. He wouldn't immediately be a superstar, though.  
                  Rather it was the countless hours of early morning workouts by  
                  himself in the gymnasium that escalated Kobe's talents. </P> 
                  <P>Kobe became a better player every year he played at Lower  
                  Marion and soon enough, he had developed into one of the  
                  premier talents at the high school level. He sold out the  
                  games everywhere he played during his junior and senior years  
                  and he didn't disappoint anyone. He once packed the school gym  
                  so much that it caused a traffic jam on the main highway just  
                  outside the school. </P>He went on to finish his high school  
                  career as the all-time leading point scorer in Pennsylvania  
                  history with a total of 2, 883 points. Kobe's highly decorated  
                  high school career made him the 13th overall choice by the  
                  Charlotte Hornets in the 1996 NBA draft. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN
