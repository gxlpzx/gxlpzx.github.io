      <p><span class="font">With the Olympics of the year 2000 being held,  
      Sydney is the focus of the world’ attention. Meanwhile, Chinese are  
      enthusiastic about 2008 Games bid.<br> 
      <br> 
      The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the candidates of 2008  
      Games this summer. Beijing is one the list with its opponents being Paris,  
      Toronto, Osaka, and Istanbul.<br> 
      <br> 
      To become the host of 2008 Summer Olympic Games is the wish of every  
      citizen of Beijing. Wherever you go in the city, the slogan &quot; New  
      Beijing, Great Olympics &quot; will catch your eye. It shows up the public  
      aspiration.<br> 
      <br> 
      &quot;Most of the taxis in Beijing are designed for Asian people, and I'm  
      afraid that tall foreign friends may feel uncomfortable sitting in the  
      cars if the 2008 Olympics are held here,&quot; said Wang Weidong, a taxi  
      driver. What he said expresses the strong feeling among the citizens. Wang  
      also said, &quot; To host the games will undoubtedly benefit Beijing and  
      China greatly, but I believe to get the ultimate win, we need to join our  
      efforts.&quot;<br> 
      <br> 
      Beijing has devised a plan to make the city greener, which is only one of  
      the measures to be taken. The plan covers improvement of air quality and  
      water quality. Everyone will be motivated to work for a better Beijing, an  
      official said.<br> 
      <br> 
      And the city will also update sports facilities, such as building a  
      Colossal Olympic Center. Advanced TV broadcast systems will also be  
      available.<br> 
      <br> 
      On July 15 2001, during its 112th session in Moscow, the IOC will vote for  
      the host city of 2008 Games.</span></p>
