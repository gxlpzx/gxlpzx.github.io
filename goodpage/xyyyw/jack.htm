      <P>American singer dancer, and song writer Michael Jackson performs during    
      a 1993 concert tour i<IMG align=left src="mingxing.files/jason.gif" width="104" height="315">n Asia. Jackson began his career as a child performing with his    
      brothers in the group known as the Jackson Five, and achieved worldwide    
      fame as solo performer, largely due to his highly personal style of    
      singing and dancing. Jackson's greatest music success, the 1982 album    
      Thriller, won a unprecedented eight Grammy Awards, produced a    
      record-breaking seven Top Ten hits, and became the best-selling album in    
      history. Because of Jackson's eccentric and reclusive lifestyle, he has    
      been a frequent target of the media spotlight. <BR><BR><BR>单词注释： <BR>1.
