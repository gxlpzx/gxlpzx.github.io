      important for a country . China has Tree Planting Day . It's on March 12 , 
      every year.In this way, thousands of trees will be planted on the hill , 
      by the river or other places that they could be planted!<BR>Spring is the 
      best time for planting trees because it 's warm and the ground is exactly 
      right .Do you know how to plant trees?First , you must dig a hole large 
      enough for trees, but it is not necessary to be very deep. Then knock a 
      long, strong stick into the earth next to the hole. Tie the trees to the 
      top of the stick to make sure that it is straight. And then put the trees 
      in the hole and put the earth back and push it down with the foot several 
      times .At last , you must water the trees well , as often as possible .You 
      see , planting trees is not difficult , but it's very hard to keep trees 
      alive .Now a lot of young trees have been cut down. And some of them have 
      been destroyed by animals or wind.So we must do much more things to 
      stopping the trees from being cut or destroyed .It's hard but it can be 
      done well .The Great Green Wall is the best example.<BR>We must not stop 
      the work of planting trees every year, the more ,the better.<BR>（ ）1.On

      Ms. before a woman's name when they do not know whether the woman is

      want to be equal to men in this way. These women feel that it is not 
      important for people to know whether they are married or not.<BR>There are 
      some problems with Ms, homever. Not all women like touse Ms. Some like the 
      older ways of doing things. Some find it difficult to pronounce. (Mr

      especially at night. Many people do not go out alone into the streets

      unusal answer to the problem. As a singer, she has to drive alone to clubs 
      late at night. Then she has to drive home after the show.<BR>The singer 
      needs a "friend". So she has got herself Bob-- a balloon that looks like a
