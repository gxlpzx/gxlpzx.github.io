<p>3.MIT毕业生<br>
<br>
Reaching the end of a job interview, the Human Resources person<br>
asked the hot-shot young Engineer, fresh out of MIT, &quot;And what<br>
starting salary were you looking for?&quot; The engineer cooly said,<br>
&quot;In the neighborhood of $125,000 a year, depending on the benefits<br>
package.&quot; The interviewer said, &quot;Well, what would you say to a<br>
package of 5 weeks vacation, 14 paid holidays, full medical and<br>
dental, company matching retirement fund to 50% of salary, and<br>
a company car leased every 2 years - for starters, say, a red<br>
Corvette?&quot; The engineer tried to control his excitement, but sat<br>
straight up and said, &quot;Wow! Are you kidding?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; the interviewer shrugged, &quot;But you started it.&quot;</p>
