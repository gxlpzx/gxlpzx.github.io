<p>1. 租房</p>
<p>A large family, with seven children, moved to a new<br>
city. They were having a difficult time finding an<br>
apartment to live in. Many apartments were large enough,<br>
but the landlords objected to the large family. After<br>
several days of searching, the father asked the mother<br>
to take the four younger children to visit the cemetery,<br>
while he took the older three to find an apartment.<br>
<br>
After they had looked most of the morning they found a<br>
place that was just right. Then the landlord asked the<br>
usual question: &quot;How many children do you have?&quot; The<br>
father answered with a deep sigh, &quot;Seven...but four are<br>
with their dear mother in the cemetery.&quot; He got the<br>
apartment.!</p>
