      <p align="justify" class="font" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span class="font">Hong 
      Kong-made film “Journey to the West” hits the taste of more and more 
      Chinese youth, especially the college students. Quoting the 
      “classical” dialogue in the film becomes a common practice of their 
      daily life.<br>
      <br>
      The film is considered “a wild adaptation” of the ancient Chinese 
      classic novel written by Wu Chen’en. Starred by Steven Chow (Zhou Xinchi), 
      a well-known Hong Kong comedian, the film is designed as a post-modern, 
      tragic-comedy. Amused by the funny language, the “Journey” fans are 
      also touched by the love story of the Monkey King.<br>
      <br>
      According to the 21st Century, Qinghua University is regarded as the place 
      for the film’s revival. The film’s initial box-office record was poor. 
      On average a Qinghua student may have seen this film for at least four 
      times. Its funny lines become part of their daily language.<br>
      <br>
      Qinghua’s famous BBS pushed on the trend. An increasing number of 
      homepages and websites of “Journey” or “Steven Chow” boomed up 
      after the film became known throughout the country. The film is generally 
      regarded as a classic of the so-called X-generation in China.</span></p>
