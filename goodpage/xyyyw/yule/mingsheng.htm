<p>4.名气是什么？<br>
<br>
Three executives were sitting around trying to put a<br>
definition on the word &quot;fame.&quot; One said: &quot;Fame is<br>
being invited to the White House for a talk with the<br>
President.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second executive said: &quot;No, fame is being invited to<br>
the White House for a talk with the President-and when<br>
the Hot Line interrupts the conversation, he doesn't<br>
answer it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The third executive said, &quot;You're both wrong. Fame is<br>
being invited to the White House for a talk with the<br>
President and when the Hot Line rings, he answers it,<br>
listens a moment, and then says...&quot;here, it's for you.&quot;</p>
