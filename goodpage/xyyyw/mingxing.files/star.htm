      <P>Graf, Steffi (1969- ), German professional tennis player, who in 1988    
      became only the fifth player to win the grand slam of tennis, with    
      victories at the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the    
      United States Open in one calendar year. Graf was born in Brühl, West    
      Germany (now part of Germany). Coached by her father, Peter, a soccer    
      star, and encouraged by her tennis-playing mother, Heidi, she was already    
      playing tennis at the age of six. In 1982, at the age of 13, Graf became    
      the second-youngest tennis player ever to be ranked as a    
      professional.<BR><BR>　　<img border="0" src="star.files/3.jpg" style="float: left" width="200" height="150">By 1985 Graf had reached the number-six ranking,    
      but she had not yet won a tournament. In 1986, however, she won eight    
      singles championships, including victories in tournament finals over the    
      dominant players in women's tennis, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert.    
      In 1987 Graf won 45 consecutive matches and captured 11 tournaments,    
      including the French, Italian, and German opens and the Women's    
      International Tennis Association's indoor and outdoor championships. In 79    
      matches that year, her only losses were to Navratilova in the finals at    
      Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.</P>   
      <P>　　In 1988, by winning Wimbledon and the Australian, French, and U.S.    
      opens, Graf became the fifth player to achieve the grand slam, following    
      Don Budge in 1938, Maureen Connolly in 1953, Rod Laver in 1962 and 1969,    
      and Margaret Smith Court in 1970. Graf also won the gold medal at the    
      Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. She opened 1989 with a fifth    
      consecutive grand-slam tournament victory by winning the Australian Open.    
      She did not win the French Open in 1989, but she retained her    
      titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. In 1990 she won the Australian    
      Open, and in 1991 she won Wimbledon. She repeated her Wimbledon title in    
      1992, also winning the silver medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona,    
      Spain, losing in the final to American player Jennifer Capriati. In 1993    
      Graf won three grand slam tournaments -- Wimbledon and the French and U.S.    
      opens. In 1994 she won the Australian Open. The following year she again    
      won Wimbledon and the French and U.S. opens. She continued her success    
      into 1996, repeating her titles at all three events. Although both    
      suffered numerous injuries, Graf and Serbian-born player Monica Seles    
      developed a rivalry in the early and mid-1990s as the world's two best    
      female players. In early June of 1999, she again won the French Open    
      singles title in Paris, defeating top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland    
      on June 5, losing the first set 6-4 before winning the last two, 7-5 and    
      6-2. </P><P align="center"><B>&lt; <a href="../jack.htm">Michael Jackson</a>
