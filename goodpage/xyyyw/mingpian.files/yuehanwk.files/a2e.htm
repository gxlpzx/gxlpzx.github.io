<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>Jean-Christophe
<P>Romain Rolland
<P>Jean-Christophe is a two-thousand-page novel originally published in ten 
volumes. the painstaking record of the artistic development of a musical genius. 
Romain Rolland set out to portray the adventures of the soul of his hero and 
succeeded magnificently; in addition he broke down the artistic barrier between 
France and Germany. The experiences of Jean-Christophe are those of every genius 
who turns from the past to serve the future. In 1915 Rolland was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for Literature, in great part for Jean-Christophe.
<P>Melchior Krafft was a virtuoso, his father Jean Michel a famous conductor. It 
was no wonder that Melchior's son, Christophe, should be a musician.
<P>Louisa, Melchior's wife, was a stolid woman of the lower class. Her 
father-in-law had been furious at his son for marrying beneath him, but he was 
soon won over by the patient goodness of Louisa. It was fortunate that there was 
a strong tie between them, for Melchoir drank and wasted his money. Often the 
grandfather gave his little pension to Louisa because there was no money for the 
family.
<P>Melchior by chance one day heard his three-year-old Christophe playing at the 
piano. In his drunken enthusiasm, Melchior conceived the idea of creating a 
musical prodigy. So began Christophe's lessons. Over and over he played his 
scales; over and over he practiced until he was letter perfect. Often he 
rebelled. Whipping only made him more rebellious, but in the end the piano 
always pulled him back.
<P>His grandfather noticed that he would often improvise melodies as he played 
with his toys. Sitting in a different room, he would transcribe those airs and 
arrange them. Christophe showed real genius in composition.
<P>At the age of seven and a half Christophe was ready for his first concert. 
Dressed in a ridiculous costume, he was presented at court as a child prodigy of 
six. He played works of some of the German masters and then performed with great 
success his own compositions gathered into an expensive privately printed 
volume, The Pleasures of Childhood: Aria, Minuetto, Valse, and Marcia, Opus I, 
by Jean-Christophe Krafft. The grand duke was delighted and bestowed the favor 
of the court on the prodigy.
<P>Before reaching his teens, Christophe was firmly installed as official second 
violinist in the court orchestra, where his father was concert master. 
Rehearsals, concerts, composition, lessons to give and take --- that was his 
life. He became the mainstay of the family financially, even collecting his 
father's wages before Melchior could get his hands on them. All the other phases 
of his life were neglected; no one even bothered to teach him table manners.
<P>When Melchior finally drowned himself, his death was a financial benefit to 
the Kraffts. But when Jean Michel died, it was a different matter. Christophe's 
two brothers were seldom home, and only Louisa and her musician son were left. 
To save money, they moved into a smaller, more wretched flat.
<P>Meanwhile Christophe was going through a series of love affairs which always 
terminated unhappily because of his unswerving honesty and lack of social 
graces. In his early twenties he took Ada, a vulgar shop girl, for his mistress. 
Because of gossip, he found it much harder to get and keep pupils. When he dared 
to publish a criticism of the older masters, he lost his standing at court. He 
had almost decided to leave Germany.
<P>At a peasant dance one night he protected Lorchen, a farm girl, from a group 
of drunken soldiers. In the ensuing brawl, one soldier was killed and two were 
seriously injured. With a warrant out for his arrest, Christophe escaped to 
Paris.
<P>Once in France, a country he greatly admired, Christophe found it difficult 
to acclimate himself. He met a group of wealthy and cynical Jews, Americans, 
Belgians, and Germans, but he judged their sophistication painful and their 
affectations boring. His compositions, although appreciated by a few, were not 
generally well received at first.
<P>After a time, with increasing recognition, he found himself alternately 
praised and blamed by the critics. But he was noticed, and that was the 
important thing. Although he was received in wealthy homes and given 
complimentary tickets for theaters and concerts, he was still desperately poor.
<P>At the home of the Stevens family, where he was kindly received, he 
instructed Colette, the coquettish daughter, and the younger, gentler Grazia, 
her cousin. Without falling in love with Colette, he was for a time her teacher 
and good friend. Grazia, who adored him. was only another pupil.
<P>One night a blushing, stammering young man of letters was introduced to him. 
It was Olivier, who had long been a faithful admirer of Christophe's music. 
Christophe was immediately attracted to Olivier, although at first he was not 
quite sure why. Olivier's face was only hauntingly familiar.
<P>It turned out that Olivier was the younger brother of Antoinette, a girl 
whose image Christophe cherished. Before he left Germany, a Jewish friend had 
given Christophe tickets for a box at the theater. Knowing no one to ask to 
accompany him, he went alone and in the lobby saw a French governess who was 
being turned away from the box office. Impulsively, Christophe took her in with 
him.The Grunebaums, the girl's employers, had expected to be invited also, and 
they were angry at the fancied slight. Antoinette was dismissed from their 
employ.
<P>As she was returning to France, Christophe caught a glimpse of her on the 
train. That was all the contact he ever had with Antoinette. Now he learned that 
she had worn herself out by supporting Olivier until he could enter the Ecole 
Normale. When he finally passed the entrance examinations, she had already 
contracted consumption, and she died before Christophe came to Paris.
<P>Finding a real friend in Olivier, Christophe took an apartment with him. The 
house was only middle-class or less; but in that house and its inhabitants, and 
with Olivier's guidance, Christophe began to find the real soul of France. Away 
from the sophisticated glitter of Paris, the ordinary people lived calm and 
purposeful lives filled with the ideal of personal liberty.
<P>Olivier became a champion of Christophe and helped establish his reputation 
in the reviews. Then some one, an important person, worked anonymously on 
Christophe's behalf. In a few years he found himself famous in France and abroad 
as the foremost composer of the new music.
<P>Olivier's marriage to the shallow Jacqueline separated the two friends. In 
his eventful life Christophe made many more friends, but none so dear as 
Olivier. He did, however, discover his anonymous benefactor. It was Grazia, no 
longer in love with him and married to a secretary of the Austrian legation.
<P>Jacqueline left Olivier, and he and Christophe became interested in the 
syndicalist movement. They attended a May Day celebration which turned into a 
riot. Olivier was fatally stabbed. After killing a soldier, Christophe fled the 
country.
<P>During his exile in Switzerland, Christophe went through an unhappy love 
affair with Anna, the wife of a friend, and the consequent sense of guilt 
temporarily stilled his genius. But with the help of the now widowed Grazia, 
Christophe spent ten fruitful years in Switzerland.
<P>When he returned to France, he was sought after and acclaimed. He was vastly 
amused to find himself an established master, and even considered out of date by 
younger artists.
<P>Although Grazia and Christophe never married, they remained steadfast and 
consoling friends. Grazia died in Egypt, far from her beloved Christophe. He 
died in Paris. To the end, Christophe was uncompromising, for he was a true 
artist.
