<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA
<P>Ernest Hemingway 
<P>The Old Man and the Sea may very well become one of the true classics of this 
generation. Certainly, the qualities of Ernest Hemingway's short novel are those 
which we associate with many great stories of the past: near perfection of form 
within the limitations of its subject matter, restraint of treatment, regard for 
the unities of time and place, and evocative simplicity of style. Also, like 
most great stories, it can be read on more than one level of meaning. On one it 
is an exciting but tragic adventure story. Sustained by the pride of his 
calling, the only pride he has left, a broken old fisherman ventures far out 
into the Gulf Stream and there hooks the biggest marlin ever seen in those 
waters. Then, alone and exhausted by his struggle to harpoon the giant fish, he 
is forced into a losing battle with marauding sharks; they leave him nothing but 
the skeleton of his catch. On another level the book is a fable of the 
unconquerable spirit of man, a creature capable of snatching spiritual victory 
from circumstances of disaster and material defeat. On still another it is a 
parable of religious significance, its theme supported by the writer's 
unobtrusive handling of Christian symbols and metaphors. Like Coleridge's 
Ancient Mariner, Hemingway's Cuban fisherman is a character allowing the 
imagination of his creator to operate simultaneously in two different worlds of 
meaning and value, the one real and dramatic, the other moral and devotionally 
symbolic. 
<P>For eighty four days old Santiago had not caught a single fish. At first a 
young boy, Manolin, had shared his bad fortune, but after the fortieth luckless 
day the boy's father told his son to go in another boat. From that time on 
Santiago worked alone. Each morning he rowed his skiff out into the Gulf Stream 
where the big fish were. Each evening he came in empty-handed. 
<P>The boy loved the old fisherman and pitied him. If Manolin had no money of 
his own, he begged or stole to make sure that Santiago had enough to eat and 
fresh baits for his lines. The old man accepted his kindness with humility that 
was like a quiet kind of pride. Over their evening meals of rice or black beans 
they would talk about the fish they had taken in luckier times or about American 
baseball and the great DiMaggio. At night, alone in his shack, Santiago dreamed 
of lions on the beaches of Africa, where he had gone on a sailing ship years 
before. He no longer dreamed of his dead wife. 
<P>On the eighty-fifth day Santiago rowed out of the harbor in the cool dark 
before dawn. After leaving the smell of land behind him, he set his lines. Two 
of his baits were fresh tunas the boy had given him, as well as sardines to 
cover his hooks. The lines went straight down into deep dark water. 
<P>As the sun rose he saw other boats in toward shore, which was only a low 
green line on the sea. A hovering man-of-war bird showed him where dolphin were 
chasing some flying fish, but the school was moving too fast and too far away. 
The bird circled again. This time Santiago saw tuna leaping in the sunlight. A 
small one took the hook on his stern line. Hauling the quivering fish aboard, 
the old man thought it a good omen. 
<P>Toward noon a marlin started nibbling at the bait which was one hundred 
fathoms down. Gently the old man played the fish, a big one, as he knew from the 
weight on the line. At last he struck to settle the hook. The fish did not 
surface. Instead, it began to tow the skiff to the northwest. The old man braced 
himself, the line taut across his shoulders. Although he was alone and no longer 
strong, he had his skill and knew many tricks. He waited patiently for the fish 
to tire. 
<P>The old man shivered in the cold that came after sunset. When something took 
one of his remaining baits, he cut the line with his sheath knife. Once the fish 
lurched suddenly, pulling Santiago forward on his face and cutting his cheek. By 
dawn his left hand was stiff and cramped. The fish had headed northward; there 
was no land in sight. Another strong tug on the line sliced Santiago's right 
hand. Hungry, he cut strips from the tuna and chewed them slowly while he waited 
for the sun to warm him and ease his cramped fingers. 
<P>That morning the fish jumped. Seeing it leap, Santiago knew he had hooked the 
biggest marlin he had even seen. Then the fish went under and turned toward the 
east. Santiago drank sparingly from his water bottle during the hot afternoon. 
Trying to forget his cut hand and aching back, he remembered the days when men 
had called him Campeon and he had wrestled with a giant Negro in the tavern at 
Cienfuegos. Once an airplane droned overhead on its way to Miami. 
<P>Close to nightfall a dolphin took the small hook he had rebaited. He lifted 
the fish aboard, careful not to jerk the line over his shoulder. After he had 
rested, he cut fillets from the dolphin and kept also the two flying fish he 
found in its maw. That night he slept. He awoke to feel the line running through 
his fingers as the fish jumped. Feeding line slowly, he tried to tire the 
marlin. After the fish slowed its run. he washed his cut hands in sea water and 
ate one of the flying fish. At sunrise the marlin began to circle. Faint and 
dizzy, he worked to bring the big fish nearer with each turn. Almost exhausted, 
he finally drew his catch alongside and drove in the harpoon. He drank a little 
water before he lashed the marlin to bow and stern of his skiff. The fish was 
two feet longer than the boat. No catch like it had ever been seen in Havana 
harbor. It would make his fortune, he thought, as he hoisted his patched sails 
and set his course toward the southwest. 
<P>An hour later he sighted the first shark. It was a fierce Mako, and it came 
in fast to slash with raking teeth at the dead marlin. With failing might the 
old man struck the shark with his harpoon. The Mako rolled and sank, carrying 
the harpoon with it and leaving the marlin mutilated and bloody. Santiago knew 
the scent would spread. Watching, he saw two shovel nosed sharks closing in. He 
struck at one with his knife lashed to the end of an oar and watched the 
scavenger sliding down into deep water. The other he killed while it tore at the 
flesh of the marlin. When the third appeared, he thrust at it with the knife, 
only to feel the blade snap as the fish rolled. The other sharks came at sunset. 
At first he tried to club them with the tiller from the skiff, but his hands 
were raw and bleeding and there were too many in the pack. In the darkness, as 
he steered toward the faint glow of Havana against the sky, he heard them 
hitting the carcass again and again. But the old man thought only of his 
steering and his great tiredness. He had gone out too far and the sharks had 
beaten him. He knew they would leave him nothing but the stripped skeleton of 
his great catch. 
<P>All lights were out when he sailed into the little harbor and beached his 
skiff. In the gloom he could just make out the white backbone and the upstanding 
tail of the fish. he started up the shore with the mast and furled sail of his 
boat. Once he fell under their weight and lay patiently until he could gather 
his strength. In his shack he fell on his bed and went to sleep. 
<P>There the boy found him later that morning. Meanwhile other fishermen, 
gathered about the skiff, marveled at the giant marlin, eighteen feet long from 
nose to tail. When Manolin returned to Santiago's shack with hot coffee, the old 
man awoke. The boy, he said, could have the spear of his fish. Manolin told him 
to rest, to make himself fit for the days of fishing they would have together. 
All that afternoon the old man slept, the boy sitting by his bed. Santiago was 
dreaming of lions.
