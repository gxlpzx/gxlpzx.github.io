<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>WHAT IS A GREAT BOOK? 
<P>Mortimer J. Adler 
<P>There is no end to the making of books. Nor does there seem to be any end to 
the making of lists of “great books.” There have always been more books than 
anyone could read. And as they have multiplied through the centuries, more and 
more blue-ribbon listshave had to be made. 
<P>No matter how long your life, you will, at best, be able to read only a few 
books of all that have been written, and the few you do read should include the 
best. You can rejoice in the fact that the number of such is relatively small. 
<P>The listing of the best books is as old as reading and writing. The teachers 
and librarians of ancient Alexandria did it. Quintilian did it for Roman 
education, selecting, as he said, both ancient and modern classics. In the 
Renaissance, such leaders of the revival of learning as Montaigne and Erasmus 
made lists of the books they read. 
<P>It is to be expected that the selections will change will the times. Yet 
there is a surprising uniformity in the lists which represent the best choices 
of any period. In every age, the list makers include both ancient and modern 
books in their selections, and they always wonder whether the moderns are up to 
the great books of the past. 
<P>What are the signs by which we may recognize a great book? The six I will 
mention may not be all there are, but they are the ones I've found most useful 
in explaining my choices over the years. 
<P>Great books are probably the most widely read. They are not best sellers for 
a year or two. They are enduring best sellers. GONE WITH THE WIND has had 
relatively few readers compared to the plays of Shakespeare or DON QUIXOTE. It 
would be reasonable to estimate that Homer'sliad hs been read by at least 
25,000,000 people in the last 3000 years. 
<P>A great book need not even be a best seller in its own day. It may take time 
for it to accumulate its ultimate audience. The astronomer Kepler, whose work on 
the planetary motions is now a classic, is reported to have said of his book 
that “it may wait a century for a reader, as God has waited 6000 years for an 
observer.” 
<P>Great books are popular, not pedantic. They are not written by specialists 
about specialties for specialists. Whether they be philosophy or science, or 
history or poetry, they treat of human, not academic problems. They are written 
for men, not professors. To read a textbook for advanced students, you have to 
read an elementary textbook first. But the great books can be considered 
elementary in the sense that they treat the elements of any subject matter. They 
are not related to one another as a series of textbooks, graded in difficulty or 
in the technicality of the problems with which they deal. 
<P>There is one kind of prior reading, however, which does help you to read a 
great book, and that is the other great books the author himself read. Let me 
illustrate this point by taking Euclid's elements of Geometry and Newton's 
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Euclid requires no prior study of 
mathematics. His book is generally an introduction to geometry, and to basic 
arithmetic as well. The same cannot be said for Newton, because Newton uses 
mathematics in the solution of physical problems. His style shows how deeply he 
was influenced by Euclid's treatment of ration and proportions. His book is, 
therefore, not readily intelligible, even to scientists, unless Euclid has been 
read before. 
<P>I am not saying that great scientific books can be read without effort. I am 
saying that if they are read in an historical order, the effort is rewarded. 
Just as Euclid illuminates Newton and Galileo, so they in turn help to make 
Einstein intelligible. The point applies to philosophical books as well. 
<P>Great books are always contemporary. In contrast, the books we call 
“contemporary”, because they are currently popular, last only for a year or two, 
or ten at the most. You probably cannot recall the names of many earlier best 
sellers, and you probably would not be interested in reading them. But the great 
books are never outmoded by the movement of thought or the shifting winds of 
doctrine and opinion. 
<P>People regard the “classics” as the great has-beens, the great books of other 
times. “Our times are different,” they say. On the contrary, the great books are 
not dusty remains for scholars to investigate, they are, rather, the most potent 
civilizing forces in the world today. 
<P>The fundamental human problems remain the same in all ages. Anyone who reads 
the speeches of Demosthenes and the letters of Cicero, or the essays of Bacon 
and Montaigne, will find how constant is the preoccupation of men with happiness 
and justice, with virtue and truth and even with stability and change itself. We 
may accelerate the motions of life, but we cannot seem to change the routes that 
are available to its goals. 
<P>Great books are the most readable. They will not let you down if you try to 
read them well. They have more ideas per page than most books have in their 
entirety. That is why you can read a great book over and over again and never 
exhaust its contents. 
<P>They can be read at many different levels of understanding, as well as with a 
great diversity of interpretations. Obvious examples are GULLIVER'S TRAVELS , 
ROBINSON CRUSOE and the ODYSSEY. Children can read them with enjoyment, but fail 
to find therein all the beauty and significance which delight an adult mind. 
<P>Great books are the most instructive. This follows from the fact that they 
are original communications; they contain what cannot be found it other books. 
Whether you ultimately agree or disagree with what they say, these are the 
primary teachers of mankind; they have made the basic contributions to human 
thought. 
<P>It is almost unnecessary to add that the great books are the most influential 
books. In the tradition of learning, they have been most discussed by readers 
who have also been writers. These are the books about which there are many other 
books --- countless and, for the most part, forgotten. 
<P>Great books deal with the persistently unsolved problems of human life. There 
are genuine mysteries in the world that mark the limits of human knowing and 
thinking. Inquiry not only begins with wonder, but usually ends with it also. 
Great minds acknowledge mysteries honestly. Wisdom is fortified not destroyed, 
by understanding its limitations. 
<P>It is our privilege, as readers, to belong to the larger brotherhood of man 
which recognizes no national boundaries. I do not know how to escape from the 
strait-jacket of political nationalism. I do know how we become friends of the 
human spirit in all its manifestations, regardless of time and place. It is by 
reading the great books.
