<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>George Gordon Byron 
<P>More than any other poet Lord Byron has been identified with his own heroes 
--- with Childe Harold, the romantic traveller; with Manfred, the outcast from 
society; with Don Juan, the cynical, heartless lover. Although Byron did use his 
own life as the material for much of his poetry, it is by no means purely 
autobiographical. It is, however, in his long poems that Byron's genius most 
truly resides rather than in the lyrics which usually represent him in 
selections. 
<P>Byron was born into an aristocratic family of doubtful reputation. His father 
died of drink and debauchery when Byron was 3, and when he was 10 his 
great-uncle --- the ‘wicked’ Lord Byron --- also died. Byron inherited the 
title, a vast house called Newstead Abbey, and estates already mortgaged or in 
decay. 
<P>Byron's father, by his first marriage, had a daughter, Augusta, Byron's 
half-sister. His father's second wife, Byron's own mother, was a proud, 
irascible, Calvinistic Scotswoman named Catherine Gordon of Gight. He was born 
with a malformed foot --- a disability which tortured him with 
self-consciousness in his youth. He went to Harrow and to Trinity College, 
Cambridge, where, amongst other eccentricities, he kept a bear. While an 
undergraduate he published his first book of poems. Hours of Idleness. The 
adverse criticism it deservedly got stung Byron not to despair but to revenge, 
and he replied with a satire in the manner of Pope called English Bards and 
Scotch Reviewers. After Cambridge, Byron went on the grand tour of Europe, 
traditional for men of his education; but owing to the Napoleonic Wars, his 
route took him, not overland, as was usual by way of Paris to Rome, but by sea 
to Lisbon, Spain, and the Mediterranean. For nearly 2 years he wandered about 
Greece and the Aegean Islands. This was the shaping time of his imagination. 
<P>When he was 23 his mother died, and he came home, an extremely handsome young 
man, to install himself boisterously at Newstead Abbey. He entered London 
society and spoke in the House of Lords. It was now that he showed his friend, 
R.C. Dallas, a new satire, Hints from Horace. Dallas, secretly not much 
impressed, asked if he had anything else; Byron quite casually said that he had 
‘a lot of Spenserian stanzas’. Dallas read them with astonishment and delight, 
showed them to Murray the publisher, and on 20 February 1812, the first two 
cantos of Childe Harold were published. They took the town by storm. Byron 
became famous overnight. He could not now write fast enough, and in the next 4 
years appeared a series of romantic poems, the best among them being he Corsair 
and he Bride of Abydos. It is said that 14,000 copies of The Corsair were sold 
in a day. 
<P>Byron had always been susceptible to women and attractive to them; now that 
he was successful they threw themselves at his head. For 3 years he lived ;in 
the limelight, and then, quite unaccountably, married Ann Milbanke, a frigid, 
correct, intellectual woman, entirely unsuited to him, but with a lot of money. 
She bore him a daughter and left him within a year, hinting that he had an 
immoral relationship with his halfsister Augusta. Society turned against him, as 
lavish now with calumny and spite as it had been with praise and flattery. Byron 
would not stay to be insulted; he left England for good. 
<P>The next few years were spent mostly in Venice, where Byron established 
himself with a menagerie of strange animals and conducted various love-affairs. 
It was in Italy that his masterpiece Don Juan was written. This brilliant, 
caustic, rambling satire is written in a colloquial style which is the result of 
a mastery of technique. Byron, always a fluent writer, was not over-critical of 
his own work; but Beppo, A Vision of Judgement, and Don Juan more than justify 
his reputation as a great poet. His influence on European literature --- both by 
what he wrote and by the general idea of the romantic figure of Childe Harold 
--- the typical Byronic hero --- was very great. 
<P>Like many poets, Byron was at heart a man of action. He loved the idea of 
freedom, and threw himself with intense energy into the Greek struggle for 
independence from Turkey. In 1823 he left Italy for Greece, but the next year, 
worn out with the ardours of the campaign, he caught rheumatic fever and died at 
Missolonghi, mourned as a national hero by the Greeks.
