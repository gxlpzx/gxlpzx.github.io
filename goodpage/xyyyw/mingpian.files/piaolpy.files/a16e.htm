<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>Bel - Ami 
<P>By Guy de Maupassant 
<P>Georges Duroy, a former soldier, had only three francs in his pocket when he 
met his former brother officer, Charles Forestier, in Paris one evening. 
Forestier, an editor of the daily newspaper, La Vie Francaise, unhesitatingly 
lent Duroy money to buy suitable clothes and invited him to come to dinner the 
following evening to meet the owner of the paper. The Forestiers' party was a 
success for Duroy. M. Walter hired him as a reporter to write a series of 
articles on his experiences in Algeria. 
<P>It was not easy for Duroy to adapt himself to his new job. His first article 
was due the day following the dinner party. Unable to write it in proper form, 
he was forced to hurry to the Forestier home early in the morning to seek 
stylistic advice. Forestier, just leaving, referred Duroy to Mme. Forestier for 
help. Together they turned out a successful piece. With her help Duroy slowly 
built a reputation as a clever reporter, but his salary remained small. 
<P>Two months after the Forestiers' dinner party Duroy called on Mme. de 
Marelle, who had been among the guests that evening. Duroy's friendship with 
Mme. de Marelle quickly developed into an affair. De Marelle was often away from 
home, so that his wife had ample time to see her lover, at his lodgings at first 
and then at an apartment which she rented for their rendezvous. Duroy objected 
mildly to having Mme. de Marelle bear this expense, but it was not long before 
he found himself regularly accepting small sums of money from her. It was Mme. 
de Marelle's daughter Laurine who first called him " Bel-Ami ," a nickname 
gradually adopted by most of his friends. 
<P>M.Forestier suffered from a bronchial ailment. As his health grew worse, his 
disposition became unbearable at the office. Duroy determined to avenge himself 
by attempting to seduce Mme. Forestier. She gently rebuffed him, but agreed that 
they could be friends. Duroy was brash enough to propose that she become his 
wife if she were ever widowed. 
<P>At Mme. Forestier's suggestion Duroy began to cultivate Mme. Walter. The week 
following his first visit to her he was appointed editor of the "Echoes," an 
important column. He had barely assumed this position when the editor of a rival 
newspaper, a Plume, accused him falsely of receiving bribes and suppressing 
news. For the honor of La Vie Francaise Duroy was forced to challenge his 
disparager to a duel. Though neither he nor his opponent was injured, M. Walter 
was pleased with Duroy's spirit. 
<P>Duroy moved into the apartment Mme. de Marelle had rented for their meetings 
after he had promised that he would never bring anyone else there. Shortly 
afterward Forestier became seriously ill, and Duroy received a telegram asking 
him to join the Forestiers in Cannes, where they had gone for the invalid's 
health. After Forestier's death, as he and Mme. Forestier kept a vigil over the 
corpse, Duroy proposed once more. The widow made no promises but stated the next 
day that she might consider an alliance, though she warned her swain that she 
would have to be treated as an equal and her conduct left unquestioned. 
<P>Mme. Forestier returned to Paris. A year later she and Duroy were married. 
Georges du Roy de Cantel, as he now called himself at his wife's suggestion, and 
his bride had agreed to spend their honeymoon with his parents in Normandy. 
However, Mme. de Cantel spent only one day with his simple, ignorant peasant 
family in their tiny home. 
<P>The newspaper man found in his wife a valuable ally who not only aided him in 
writing his articles but also, as the friend of influential men, helped him to 
find a place in political circles. Unfortunately, friction soon developed 
between them. After he had moved into his wife's home, de Cantel found that its 
comforts had been designed to please its old master, and he soon found himself 
pushed gently into the niche his friend had occupied. Even the meals were 
prepared according to Forestier's taste. To pique his wife de Cantel began to 
call Forestier "poor Charles," always using an accent of infinite pity when he 
spoke the name. 
<P>Not long after his marriage de Cantel resumed his relationship with Mme. de 
Marelle and at the same time began an affair with Mme. Walter. He had briefly 
bemoaned the fact that he had not married wealthy young Suzanne Walter, but he 
soon became intrigued with the idea of seducing her mother, a pillar of dignity. 
His conquest was not a difficult one. Mme. Walter began to meet her lover at his 
rooms and to shower affection and attentions upon him so heavily that he quickly 
became bored. 
<P>Among Mme. de Cantel's political acquaintances was the foreign minister, 
Laroche-Mathieu, who supplied news of government activities to La Vie Francaise. 
Because the minister was also a close friend of M. Walter, it was not difficult 
for de Cantel's new paramour to learn the state secret that France would soon 
guarantee the Moroccan debt. Mme. Walter planned to buy some shares of the loan 
with the understanding that de Cantel would receive part of the profit. While 
Mme. Walter was carrying on her speculations, the de Cantels received a windfall 
in the form of a bequest from the late Count de Vaudrec, an old family friend of 
Mme. de Cantel. De Cantel objected to the Count's bequest of one million francs, 
however, on the grounds that appearances would compromise her. He allowed her to 
accept the money only after she had agreed to divide it equally with him, so 
that it would seem to outsiders as if they had both received a share. 
<P>De Cantel profited handsomely when France assumed the Moroccan debt, but his 
gains were small compared to those of Laroche-Mathieu and M. Walter, who had 
become millionaires as a result of the intrigue. One evening he and his wife 
were invited to view a painting in the Walters' magnificent new mansion. There 
de Cantel began a flirtation with Suzanne Walter; his own wife and 
Laroche-Mathieu had become intimates without attempting to conceal their 
friendship. That evening de Cantel persuaded Suzanne to agree never to accept a 
proposal without first asking his advice. At home after the reception he 
received with indifference the cross of the Legion of Honor which the foreign 
minister had given him. He felt that he was entitled to a larger reward for 
concealing news of the Moroccan affair from his readers. That spring he 
surprised his wife and Laroche-Mathieu at a rendezvous. Three months later he 
obtained a divorce, causing the minister's downfall by naming him correspondent. 

<P>A free man again, de Cantel was able to court Suzanne Walter. It was simple 
for him to persuade the girl to tell her parents she wished to marry him, to 
have her go away with him until they gave their consent to the match. 
<P>Mme. Walter was the only one at the magnificent church wedding to show any 
signs of sadness. She hated the daughter who had taken her lover, but at the 
same time she was powerless to prevent the marriage without compromising 
herself. M. Walter had managed to resign himself to having a conniving 
son-in-law, had, in fact, recognized his shrewdness by making him chief editor 
of the newspaper. Suzanne was innocently happy as she walked down the aisle with 
her father. Her new husband was also content. Greeting their well-wishers in the 
sacristy after the ceremony, he took advantage of the occasioin to reaffirm, 
with his eyes, his feelings for Mme. de Marelle. As he and his wife left the 
church, it seemed to him that it was only a stone's throw from that edifice to 
the chamber of deputies </P></BODY></HTML>
