<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>The Captain's Daughter 
<P>Alexander Pushkin 
<P>Although Peter Andreitch Grineff was registered as a sergeant in the 
Semenovsky regiment when he was very young, he was given leave to stay at home 
until he had completed his studies. When he was nearly seventeen, his father 
decided that the time had arrived to begin his military career. With his 
parents' blessing, Peter set out for distant Orenburg, in the company of his 
faithful servant, Savelitch. 
<P>The trip was not without incident. One night the travelers put up at 
Simbirsk. There, while his man went to see about some purchases, Peter was lured 
into playing billiards with a fellow soldier, Zourin, and quickly lost one 
hundred roubles. Toward eveing of the following day the young man and Savelitch 
found themselves on the snowy plain with a storm coming up. As darkness fell the 
snow grew thicker, until finally the horses could not find their way and the 
driver confessed that he was lost. They were rescued by another traveler, a man 
with such sensitive nostrils that he was able to scent smoke from a village some 
distance away and to lead them to it. The three men and their guide spent the 
night in the village. The next morning Peter presented his hareskin jacket to 
his poorly-dressed rescuer. Savelitch warned Peter that the coat would probably 
be pawned for drink. 
<P>Late that day the young man reached Orenburg and presented himself to the 
general in command. It was decided that he should join the Bailogorsk fortress 
garrison under Captain Mironoff. For his superior felt that the dull life at 
Orenburg might lead the young man into a career of dissipation. 
<P>The Bailogorsk fortress, on the edge of the Kirghis steppes, was nothing more 
than a village surrounded by a log fence. Its real commandant was not Captain 
Mironoff but his lady, Vassilissa Egorovna, a lively, firm woman who saw to the 
discipline of her husband's underlings as well as the running of her own 
household. 
<P>Peter quickly made friends with a fellow officer, Shvabrin, who had been 
exiled to the steppes for fighting a duel. He spent much time with his captain's 
family and grew deeply attached to the couple and to their daughter, Maria 
Ivanovna. After he had received his commission, he found military discipline so 
relaxed that he was able to indulge his literary tastes. 
<P>The quiet routine of Peter's life was interrupted by an unexpected quarrel 
with Shvabrin. One day he showed his friend a love poem he had written to Maria. 
Shvabrin criticized the work severely and went on to make derogatory remarks 
about Maria until they quarreled and Peter found himself challenged to a duel 
for having called the man a liar. 
<P>The next morning the two soldiers met in a field to fight but they were 
stopped by some of the garrison, for Vassilissa Egorovna had learned of the 
duel. Peter and his enemy, although apparently reconciled, intended to carry out 
their plan at the earliest opportunity. Discussing the quarrel with Maria, Peter 
leaned that Shvabrin's actions could be explained by the fact that he was her 
rejected suitor. 
<P>Assuring themselves that they were not watched, Shvabrin and Peter fought 
their duel the following day. Peter, wounded in the breast, lay unconsicous for 
five days after the fight. When he began to recover, he asked Maria to marry 
him. Shvabrin had been jailed. Then Peter's father wrote that he disapproved of 
a match with Captain Mironoff's daughter, and that he intended to have his son 
transferred from the fortress so that he might forget his foolish ideas. As 
Savelitch denied having written a letter home,Peter could only conclude that 
Shvabrin had been the informer. 
<P>Life would have become unbearable for the young man after his father's letter 
arrived if the unexpected had not happened. One evening Captain Mironoff 
informed his officers that the Yaikian Cossacks, led by Emelyan Pougatcheff, who 
claimed to be the dead Emperor Peter III, had risen and were sacking fortresses 
and committing outrages everywhere. The captain ordered his men to keep on the 
alert and to ready the cannon. 
<P>The news of Pougatcheff's uprising quickly spread through the garrison. Many 
of the Cossacks of the town sided with the rebel, so that Captain Mironoff did 
not know whom he could trust or who might betray him. It was not long before the 
captain received from the Cossack leader a manifesto ordering him to surender. 
<P>It was decided that Maria should be sent back to Orenburg, but the attack 
came early the next morning before she could leave. Captain Mironoff and his 
officers made a valiant effort to defend the town, but with the aid of Cossack 
traitors inside the walls Pougatcheff was soon master of the fortress. 
<P>Captain Mironoff and his aides were hanged. Shvabrin deserted to the rebels. 
Peter, at the intercession of old Savelitch, was spared by Pougatcheff. The 
townspeople and the garrison soldiers had no scruples about pledging allegiance 
to the rebel leader. Vassilissa Egorovna was slain when she cried out against 
her husband's murderer. 
<P>When Pougatcheff and his followers rode off to inspect the fortress, Peter 
began his search for Maria. To his great relief, he found that she had been 
hidden by the wife of the village priest, and that Shvabrin, who knew her 
whereabouts, had not revealed her identity. From Savelitch he learned that the 
servant had recognized Pougatcheff as the man to whom he had given his hareskin 
coat months before. Later the rebel leader sent for Peter and acknowleged his 
identity. 
<P>The rebel tried to persuade Peter to join the Cossacks, but respected his 
wish to rejoin his own forces at Orenburg. The next day Peter and his servant 
were given safe conduct, and Pougatcheff gave Peter a horse and a sheepskin coat 
for the journey. 
<P>Several days later the Cossacks attacked Orenburg. During a sally against 
them Peter received a disturbing message from one of the Bailogorsk Cossacks 
Shvabrin was forcing Maria to marry him. Peter wennt at once to the general and 
tried to persuade him to raise the siege and go to the rescue of the village. 
When the general refused, Peter and Savelitch started out once more for the 
Bailogorsk fortress. Intercepted and taken before Pougatcheff, Peter persuaded 
the rebel to give Maria safe conduct to Orenburg. 
<P>On the way they met a detachment of soldiers led by Captain Zourin, who 
persuaded Peter to send Maria, under Savelitch's protection to his family, while 
he himself remained with the troops in Orenburg. 
<P>The siege of Orenburg was finally lifted, and the army began its task of 
tracking down rebel units. Some months later Peter found himself near his own 
village and set off alone to visit his parents's estate. Reaching his home, he 
found the serfs in rebellion and his family and Maria captives. That day 
Shvabrin swooped down upon them with his troops. He was about to have them all 
hanged, except Maria, when they were rescued by Zourin's men. The renegade was 
shot during the encounter and taken prisoner. 
<P>Peter's parents had changed their attitude toward the captain's daughter, and 
Peter was able to rejoin Captain Zourin with the expectation that he and Maria 
would be wed in a month. Then an order came for his arrest. He was accused of 
having been in the pay of Pougatcheff, of spying for the rebel, and of having 
taken presents from him. The author of the accusations was the captive, 
Shvabrin. though Peter could easily have cleared himself by summoning Maria as a 
witness, he decided not to drag her into the matter. He was sentenced to spend 
the rest of his life in exile in Siberia. 
<P>Maria, however, was not one to let matters stand at that. Leaving Peter's 
parents, she traveled to St. Petersburg and went to Tsarskoe Selo, where the 
court was. Walking in the garden there one day, she met a woman who declared 
that she went to court on occasion and would be pleased to present her petition 
to the empress. Maria was summoned to the royal presence the same day and 
discovered that it was the empress herself to whom she had spoken. Peter 
received his pardon and soon afterward married the captain's daughter.
