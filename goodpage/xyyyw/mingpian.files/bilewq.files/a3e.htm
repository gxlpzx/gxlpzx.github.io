<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>A Farewell to Arms
<P>Ernest Hemingway Hemingway combines austere realism and poetic language to 
present a powerful argument against war and to tell a touching love story at the 
same time. Possessed of the most remarkable time sense of the period between 
wars, his disillusioned temperament and technical skill have influenced a whole 
generation of writer. In spite of its hard-boiled realism of detail and its 
tragic ending, A Farewell to Arms is nevertheless an idealistic book. The novel 
was dramatized by Laurence Stallings and was made into a motion picture. 
<P>Lieutenant Frederic Henry was a young American attached to an Italian 
ambulance unit on the Italian front. An offensive was soon to begin, and when 
Henry returned to the front from leave he learned from his friend, Lieutenant 
Rinaldi, that a group of British nurses had arrived in his absence to set up a 
British hospital unit. Rinaldi introduced him to nurse Catherine Barkley. 
<P>Between ambulance trips to evacuation posts at the front, Henry called on 
Miss Barkley. He liked the frank young English girl in a casual sort of way, but 
he was not in love with her. Before he left for the front to stand by for an 
attack, she gave him a St. Anthony medal. 
<P>At the front, as Henry and some Italian ambulance drivers were eating in a 
dugout, an Austrian projectile exploded over them. Henry, badly wounded in the 
legs, was taken to a field hospital. Later he was moved to a hospital in Milan. 

<P>Before the doctor was able to see Henry in Milan, the nurses prohibited his 
drinking wine, but he bribed a porter to bring him a supply which he kept hidden 
behind his bed. Catherine Barkley came to the hospital and Henry knew that he 
was in love with her. The doctors told Henry that he would have to lie in bed 
six months before they could operate on his knee. Henry insisted on seeing 
another doctor, who said that the operation could be performed the next day. 
Meanwhile. Catherine managed to be with Henry constantly. 
<P>After his operation, Henry convalesced in Milan with Catherine Barkley as his 
attendant. Together they dined in out of the way restaurants, and together they 
rode about the countryside in a carriage. Henry was restless and lonely at 
nights and Catherine often came to his hospital room. 
<P>Summer passed into autumn. Henry's wound had healed and he was due to take 
convalescent leave in October. He and Catherine planned to spend the leave 
together, but he came down with jaundice before he could leave the hospital. The 
head nurse accused him of bringing on the jaundice by drink, in order to avoid 
being sent back to the front. Before he left for the front, Henry and Catherine 
stayed together in a hotel room; already she had disclosed to him that she was 
pregnant. 
<P>Henry returned to the front with orders to load his three ambulances with 
hospital equipment and go south into the Po valley. Morale was at low ebb. 
Rinaldi admired the job which had been done on the knee and observed that Henry 
acted like a married man. War weariness was all-pervasive. At the front, the 
Italians, having learned that German divisions had reinforced the Austrians, 
began their terrible retreat from Caporetto. Henry drove one of the ambulances 
loaded with hospital supplies. During the retreat south, the ambulance was held 
up several times by wagons, guns, and trucks which extended in stalled lines for 
miles. Henry picked up two straggling Italian sergeants. During the night the 
retreat was halted in the rain for hours. 
<P>At daybreak Henry cut out of the long line and drove across country in an 
attempt to reach Udine by side roads. The ambulance got stuck in a muddy side 
road. The sergeants decided to leave, but Henry asked them to help dislodge the 
car from the mud. They refused and ran. Henry shot and wounded one; the other 
escaped across the fields. An Italian ambulance corpsman with Henry shot the 
wounded sergeant through the back of the head. Henry and his three comrades 
struck out on foot for Udine. On a bridge, Henry saw a German staff car and 
German bicycle troops crossing another bridge over the same stream. Within sight 
of Udine, one of Henry's group was killed by an Italian sniper. The others hid 
in a barn until it seemed safe to circle around Udine and join the main stream 
of the retreat toward the Tagliamento River. 
<P>By that time the Italian army was nothing but a frantic mob. Soldiers were 
throwing down their arms and officers were cutting insignia of rank from their 
sleeves. At the end of a long wooden bridge across the Tagliamento military 
carabiniere were seizing all officers, giving them drumhead trials, and 
executing them by the river bank. Henry was detained, but in the dark of night 
he broke free, plunged into the river, and escaped on a log. He crossed the 
Venetian plain on foot, then jumped aboard a freight train and rode to Milan, 
where he went to the hospital in which he had been a patient. There he learned 
that the English nurses had gone to Stresa. 
<P>During the retreat from Caporetto Henry had made his farewell to arms. He 
borrowed civilian clothes from an American friend in Milan and went by train to 
Stresa, where he met Catherine, who was on leave. The bartender of the hotel in 
which Henry was staying warned Henry that authorities were planning to arrest 
him for desertion the next morning; he offered his boat by means of which Henry 
and Catherine could escape to Switzerland. Henry rowed all night. By morning his 
hands were so raw that he could barely stand to touch the oars. Over his 
protests, Catherine took a turn at the rowing. They reached Switzerland safely 
and were arrested. Henry told the police that he was a sportsman who enjoyed 
rowing and that he had come to Switzerland for the winter sports. The valid 
passports and the ample funds that Henry and Catherine possessed saved them from 
serious trouble with the authorities. 
<P>During the rest of the fall and the winter the couple stayed at an inn 
outside Montreux. They discussed marriage, but Catherine would not be married 
while she was with child. They hiked, read, and talked about what they would do 
together after the war. 
<P>When the time for Catherine's confinement approached, she and Henry went to 
Lausanne to be near a hospital. They planned to return to Montreux in the 
spring. At the hospital Catherine's pains caused the doctor to use an 
anaesthetic on her. After hours of suffering she was delivered of a dead baby. 
The nurse sent Henry out to get something to eat. When he went back to the 
hospital, he learned that Catherine had had a hemorrhage. He went into the room 
and stayed with her until she died. There was nothing he could do, no one he 
could talk to, no place he could go. Catherine was dead. He left the hospital 
and walked back to his hotel in the dark. It was raining.
