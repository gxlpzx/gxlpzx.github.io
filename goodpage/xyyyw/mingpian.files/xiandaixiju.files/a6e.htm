<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>A MODERN COMEDY
<P>John Galsworthy
<P>A Modern Comedy is part of the Forsyte Chronicles (1886---1926), in which 
Galsworthy pictures the life of a large, upper middle-class family against a 
carefully detailed background of English life. Solid and very readable, this 
novel is important as a social document aside from its value as literature. The 
volume is composed of three long sections --- The White Monkey, The Silver 
Spoon, and Swan Song---originally published as separate novels, and two 
interludes. Galsworthy's social history is valuable as a record of the various 
currents of British life in the 1920's. 
<P>Soames Forsyte was a member of the board of the Providential Premium 
Reassurance Society. Against his better judgment, the society had invested much 
of its holdings in foreign securities. Because the European exchange was so 
unstable, Soames insisted that the report to the stockholders be detailed. Not 
long afterward, Butterfield, a clerk in the P.P.R.S. office, overheard a 
conversation between Elderson, the manager, and a German. The German insisted 
that Elderson, who had received commissions on the society's investments in 
Germany, should see to it that the board made good any losses if the mark fell 
in value. Accused of bribery, Elderson denied the charge and dismissed 
Butterfield. When pressed, however, Elderson escaped to the continent. The 
stockholders were outraged that the board had permitted Elderson to get away. 
Although Soames explained that any early revelation of the manager's dishonesty 
would have been futile, he received very little support from his listeners. He 
resigned from the board. 
<P>Michael Mont, Soamesâ€™ son-in-law, was a publisher. When Butterfield lost his 
job with the P.P.R.S., Soames asked Michael to give the clerk employment. 
Butterfield prospered as a salesman of special editions. 
<P>Michael's wife, Fleur, had been spoiled by her father. She was restless, 
passionate, and not in love with her husband. Wilfred Desert, an artist, was 
deeply in love with her, but she knew that he could provide only adventure, not 
love. Wilfred finally left the country for Arabia. For a time the relationship 
of Michael and Fleur appeared happier, and Fleur gave birth to a son, whom they 
named Christopher. 
<P>Before she married Michael, Fleur had been in love with her cousin, Jon 
Forsyte, but because of a family feud she could not marry him. Jon had gone to 
America, where he fell in love with a Southern girl, Anne Wilmot, and married 
her. 
<P>A year or so after Christopher's birth, Michael entered Parliament. To help 
her husband and to provide herself with diversion, Fleur entertained many 
prominent people. One night Soames overheard one of Fleur's guests, Marjorie 
Ferrar, speak of her as a snob. He asked Marjorie to leave the house. Fleur was 
impatient with her father for interfering, but she criticized Marjorie for 
creating an unpleasant scene. Marjorie demanded an apology. After an offer of 
settlement from Soames, Marjorie still insisted on the apology and took her suit 
into court, Soames and his lawyer managed to prove that Marjorie was a woman of 
irresponsible morals. Fleur won the case, but the victory brought her so many 
snubs from former friends that she was more unhappy than ever. 
<P>Francis Wilmot, whose sister Anne had married Jon, arrived from America to 
see what England was like. He stayed for a time with Fleur and Michael but, 
having fallen in love with Marjorie Ferrar, he moved out after the 
unpleasantness between Marjorie and Fleur. Marjorie refused to marry him, 
however, and go to what she felt would be a dull life in America. Francis 
contracted pneumonia in a lonely hotel and would have died but for the 
kindliness of Fleur. He recovered and went back to America. 
<P>Fleur, discontented with her life in London, persuaded Soames to take her on 
a trip around the world. Michael could not leave until the current session of 
Parliament had adjourned. He was fostering Foggartism --- a plan for a return to 
the land and for populating the dominions with the children of the British 
poor---and he felt that he must remain in London. It was arranged that he would 
meet Fleur and Soames in Vancouver five months later. Meanwhile, little 
Christopher would be in the care of his grandmother, Soames' wife. 
<P>While in Washington, Fleur, Michael, and Soames stayed at the hotel where Jon 
Forsyte and his mother, Irene, were also staying. It was Soames' first sight of 
his divorced wife in many years. He kept discreetly in the background, however, 
and saw to it that Fleur did not encounter Jon. 
<P>Back in London, with the Marjorie Ferrar affair almost forgotten, Fleur was 
eager for activity. When the general strike of 1926 began, she opened a canteen 
for volunteer workers. One day she saw Jon there. He had come over from France 
to work during the strike. Jon's conscience would not let him fall in love again 
with Fleur, but she managed to be near him as often as she could. After a single 
night together, Jon wrote that he could not see her again. 
<P>Foggartism having met with high disfavor and unpopularity, Michael became 
interested in slum improvement. Fleur, still smarting from Jon's rebuff, 
established a country rest home for working girls. Michael's work had taught him 
that the poor would never have consented to part with their children, even 
though keeping them would always mean privation and suffering. He realized that 
he was well out of Foggartism. 
<P>Soames, unhappy in an environment of post-war confusion and family unrest, 
spent more and more time among his collection of great paintings. One night, 
awakened by the odor of smoke, he discovered that his picture gallery was on 
fire. With the aid of his chauffeur, he managed to save many of his pictures by 
tossing them out the window. At last, when they could stay in the house no 
longer, they went outside, where Soames directed the firemen as well as he 
could. Then he saw that one of his heavily framed pictures was about to fall 
from the window above. He also saw that Fleur was deliberately standing where 
the frame would fall on her. He ran to push her out of the way, and received the 
blow himself. He died from exhaustion and from the injury. Fleur was further 
desolated because she knew that her own desire for death had killed her father. 
The death of Soames brought her to her senses, however. Michael was assured that 
her affair with Jon was over forever. </P></BODY></HTML>
