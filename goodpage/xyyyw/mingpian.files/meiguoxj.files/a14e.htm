<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>An American Tragedy 
<P>When Clyde Griffiths was still a child, his religious-minded parents took him 
and his brothers and sisters around the streets of various cities, where they 
prayed and sang in public. The family was always very poor, but the 
fundamentalist faith of the Griffiths was their hope and mainstay throughout the 
storms and troubles of life. 
<P>Young Clyde was never religious, however, and he always felt ashamed of the 
existence his parents were living. As soon as he was old enough to make 
decisions for himself, he decided to go his own way. At sixteen he got a job as 
a bellboy in a Kansas City hotel. There the salary and the tips he received 
astonished him. For the first time in his life he had money in his pocket, and 
he could dress well and enjoy himself. Then a tragedy overwhelmed the family. 
Clyde's sister ran away, supposedly to be married. Her elopement was a great 
blow to the parents, but Clyde himself did not brood over the matter. Life was 
too pleasant for him; more and more he enjoyed the luxuries which his job 
provided. He made friends with the other bellhops and joined them in parties 
that centered around liquor and women. Clyde soon became familiar with drink and 
brothels. 
<P>One day he discovered that his sister was back in town. The man with whom she 
had run away had deserted her, and she was penniless and pregnant. Knowing his 
sister needed money, Clyde gave his mother a few dollars for her. He promised to 
give her more; instead he bought an expensive coat for a girl in the hope that 
she would yield herself to him. One night he and his friends went on a party in 
a car that did not belong to them. Coming back from their outing, hey ran over a 
little girl. In their attempt to escape, they wrecked the car. Clyde fled to 
Chicago. 
<P>In Chicago he got work at the Union League Club, where he eventually met his 
wealthy uncle, Samuel Griffiths. The uncle, who owned a factory in Lycurgus, New 
York, took a fancy to Clyde and offered him work in the factory. Clyde went to 
Lycurgus. There his cousin, Gilbert, resented this cousin from the Middle West. 
The whole family, with the exception of his uncle, considered Clyde beneath them 
socially, and would not accept him into their circle. Clyde was given a job at 
the very bottom of the business, but his uncle soon made him a supervisor. 
<P>In the meantime Sondra Finchley, who disliked Gilbert, began to invite Clyde 
to parties she and her friends often gave. Her main purpose was to annoy 
Gilbert. Clyde's growing popularity forced the Griffiths to receive him 
socially, much to Gilbert's disgust. 
<P>In the course of his work at the factory Clyde met Roberta Alden, with whom 
he soon fell in love. Since it was forbidden for a supervisor to mix socially 
with an employee, they had to meet secretly. Clyde attempted to persuade Roberta 
to give herself to him, but the girl refused. At last, rather than lose him, she 
consented and became his mistress. 
<P>As the same time Clyde was becoming fascinated by Sondra. He came to love her 
and hoped to marry her, and thus acquire the wealth and social position for 
which he yearned. Gradually he began breaking dates with Roberta in order to be 
with Sondra every moment that she could spare him. Roberta began to be 
suspicious and eventually found out the truth. 
<P>By that time she was pregnant. Clyde went to drug stores for medicine that 
did not work. He attempted to find a doctor of questionable reputation. Roberta 
went to see one physician who refused to perform an operation. Clyde and Roberta 
were both becoming desperate, and Clyde saw his possible marriage to the girl as 
a dismal ending to all his hopes for a bright future. He told himself that he 
did not love Roberta, that it was Sondra whom he wished to marry. Roberta asked 
him to marry her for the sake of her child, saying she would go away afterward, 
if he wished, so that he could be free of her. Clyde would not agree to her 
proposal and grew more irritable and worried. 
<P>One day he read in the newspaper an item about the accidental drowning of a 
couple who had gone boating. Slowly a plan began to form in his mind. He told 
Roberta he would marry her and persuaded her to accompany him to an isolated 
lake resort. There, as though accidentally, he lunged toward her. She was hit by 
his camera and fell into the water. Clyde escaped, confident that her drowning 
would look like an accident, even though he had planned it all carefully. 
<P>But he had been clumsy. Letters that he and Roberta had written were found, 
and when her condition became known he was arrested. His uncle obtained an 
attorney for him. At his trial, the defense built up an elaborate case in his 
favor. But in spite of his lawyer's efforts, he was found guilty and sentenced 
to be electrocuted. His mother came to see him and urged him to save his soul. A 
clergyman finally succeeded in getting Clyde to write a statementâ€”a declaration 
that he repented of his sins. It is doubtful whether he did. He died in the 
electric chair, a young man tempted by his desire for luxury and wealth.
