<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>Crime and Punishment 
<P>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski 
<P>Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished student in St. Petersburg, dreamed of 
committing the perfect crime: With an ax he murdered an old widowed pawnbroker 
and her stepsister, and stole some jewelry from their flat. 
<P>Back in his room, Raskolnikov received a summons from the police. Weak from 
hunger and illness, he prepared to make a full confession. But the police had 
called merely to ask him to pay a debt his landlady had reported to them. When 
he discovered what they wanted, he collapsed from relief. Upon being revived, he 
was questioned; his answers provoked suspicion. 
<P>Raskolnikov hid the jewelry under a rock in a courtyard. He returned to his 
room, where he remained for four days in a high fever. When he recovered, he 
learned that the authorities had visited him while he was delirious and that he 
had said things during his fever which tended to cast further suspicion on him. 
<P>Luzhin, betrothed to Raskolnikov's sister Dounia, came to St. Petersburg from 
the provinces to prepare for the wedding. Raskolnikov resented Luzhin because he 
knew his sister was marrying to provide money for her destitute brother. Luzhin 
visited the convalescent and left in a rage when the young man made no attempt 
to hide his dislike for him. 
<P>A sudden calm came upon the young murderer; he went out and read the accounts 
of the murders in the papers. While he was reading, a detective joined him. The 
student, in a high pitch of excitement caused by his crime and by his sickness, 
talked too much, revealing to the detective that he might well be the murderer. 
However, no evidence could be found that would throw direct suspicion on him. 
<P>Later, witnessing a suicide attempt in the slums of St. Petersburg, 
Raskolnikov decided to turn himself over to the police; but he was deterred when 
his friend, an ex-clerk named Marmeladov; was struck by a carriage and killed. 
Raskolnikov gave the widow a small amount of money he had received from his 
mother. Later he attended a party given by some of his friends and discovered 
that they, too, suspected him of complicity in the murder of the two women. 
<P>Back in his room, Raskolnikov found his mother and his sister, who were 
awaiting his return. Unnerved at their appearance and not wanting them to be 
near him, he placed them in the care of his friend, Razumihin, who, upon meeting 
Dounia, was immediately attracted to her. 
<P>In an interview with Porfiry, the chief of the murder investigation, 
Raskolnikov was mentally tortured by questions and ironic statements until he 
was ready to believe that he had been all but apprehended for the double crime. 
Partly in his own defense, he expounded his theory that any means justified the 
ends of a man of genius, and that sometimes he believed himself a man of genius. 

<P>Raskolnikov proved to his mother and Dounia that Luzhin was a pompous fool, 
and the angry suitor was dismissed. Razumihin had by that time replaced Luzhin 
in the girl's affections. 
<P>Meanwhile Svidrigailov, who had caused Dounia great suffering while she had 
been in his employ as a governess, arrived in St. Petersburg. His wife had died 
and he had followed Dounia, as he explained, to atone for his sins against her 
by settling upon her a large amount of money. 
<P>Razumihin received money from a rich uncle and went into the publishing 
business with Dounia. They asked Raskolnikov to join them in the venture, but 
the student, whose mind and heart were full of turmoil, declined; he said 
goodbye to his friend and to his mother and sister and asked them not to try to 
see him again. 
<P>He went to Sonia, the prostitute daughter of the dead Marmeladov. They read 
Sonia's Bible together, Raskolnikov deeply impressed by the wretched girl's 
faith. He felt a great sympathy for Sonia and promised to tell her who had 
committed the murders of the old pawnbroker and stepsister. Svidrigailov, who 
rented the room next to Sonia's, overheard the conversation ; he anticipated 
Raskolnikov's disclosure with interest. 
<P>Tortured in his own mind, Raskolnikov went to the police station, where 
Porfiry played another game of cat-and-mouse with him. His conscience and his 
imagined insecurity had resulted in immense suffering and torment of mind for 
Raskolnikov. 
<P>At a banquet given by Marmeladov's widow for the friends of her late husband, 
Luzhin accused Sonia of stealing money from his room. He had observed 
Raskolnikov's interet in Sonia and he wished to hurt the student for having 
spoken against him to Dounia. The girl was saved by the report of a neighbor who 
had seen Luzhin slipping money into Sonia's pocket. Later, in Sonia's room, 
Raskolnikov confessed his crime and admitted that in killing the two women he 
had actually destroyed himself. 
<P>Svidrigailov, having overheard the confession, disclosed his knowledge to 
Raskolnikov. Believing that Porfiry suspected him of the murder and realizing 
that Svidrigailov knew the truth, Raskolnikov found life unbearable. Then 
Porfiry told Raskolnikov outright that he was the murderer, at the same time 
promising Raskolnikov that a plea of temporary insanity would be placed in his 
behalf and his sentence would be mitigated if he confessed. Raskolnikov delayed 
his confession. 
<P>Svidrigailov, having informed Dounia of the truth concerning her brother, 
offered to save the student if Dounia would consent to be his wife. He made this 
offer to her in his room, which he had locked after tricking her into the 
meeting. He released her when she attempted unsuccessfully to shoot him with a 
pistol she had brought with her. Convinced at last that Dounia would have none 
of him, Svidrigailov gave her a large sum of money and ended his life with a 
pistol. 
<P>Raskolnikov, after being reassured by his mother and his sister of their love 
for him, and by Sonia of her undying devotion, turned himself over to the 
police. He was tried and sentenced to serve eight years in Siberia. Dounia and 
Razumihin, now successful publishers, were married. Sonia followed Raskolnikov 
to Siberia, where she stayed in a village near the prison camp. In her goodness 
to Raskolnikov and to the other prisoners, she came to be known as Little Mother 
Sonia. With her help, Raskolnikov began his regeneration. </P></BODY></HTML>
