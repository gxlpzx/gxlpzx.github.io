<P>Opera in three acts by G. Puccini, Libretto by G. Giacosa and L. Illica.  
First performance: Milan, 1904.  
<P>Characters: Cio-cio-San, called Madama Butterfly (soprano) ; Suzuki, her  
servant (mezzo-soprano); B.F.Pinkerton, Lieutenant, U.S. Navy (tenor);  
Sharpless, U.S. Consul (baritone) ; Goro, marriage Pinkerton (mezzo-soprano);  
Cio-cio-san's child (silent).Nagasaki, at the turn of the century  
<P>Act I: Lieutenant Pinkerton, Making last-minute arrangements for his wedding,  
is shown through his new house overlooking the harbor of Nagasaki by Goro, the  
marriage broker, Three servants, including the maid Suzuki, are introduced.  
<P>Sharpless, the Consul,arrives. As he sits down for a drink with Pinkerton,  
the young Lieutenant expounds the philosophy of the roving Yankee who ventures  
forth boldly, expecting the fairest of every land as his reward. The  
conversation then turns to the bride. Goro praises her beauty, and Pinkerton  
sends him to fetch her. The mere thought of his bride moves Pinkethon to  
raptures, but the kindly Consul warns him not to betray a girl who, to judge  
from her behavior, takes this marriage very seriously. Goro now  
returns,announcing the arrival of Butterfly and her companions. the girls can  
already be heard in the distance chattering gaily without a thought of the  
disaster which is beginning to unfold.  
<P>Now the girls have reached the house, and Butterfly is ready to start a new  
life. She tells her freinds that she is the happiest girl in Japan, or rather in  
the world. When the introductions are over, the bride tells Pinkerton that she  
comes from a once rich family that later met with ill-fortune, whereupon she was  
forced to earn a living as a geisha. Soon some officials and Butterfly's  
relations arrive.  
<P>Pinkerton approaches Butterfly, and she commences to unburden herself of her  
belongings, which she has been carrying in the sleeves of her kimono. Among them  
is something she does not want to show in front of all the people, but Goro  
gives Pinkerton a whispered explanation: it is the dagger sent by the Mikado to  
her father with order to commit harakiri. Now Butterfly confides to Pinkerton  
that she has secretly embraced Christianity, so that her fate may be linked  
closer to that of her husband.  
<P>The marriage ceremony is performed. Then the officials, including the Consul,  
congratulate the groom and leave. All are drinking a toast to the young couple  
when suddenly a voice from the distance furiously calls and curses Cio-Cio-San.  
It is her uncle. the Bonze, who has found out about her conversion. He arrives  
and commands all the relations to renounce Butterfly. When Pinkerton finally  
intercedes, all leave, repeating the curse over and over.  
<P>Butterfly is standing motionless and silent. her face buried in her hands.  
but her despair quickly gives way to childlike happiness under Pinkerton's  
gentle words of love. Slowly night begins to fall, and the pair remains alone.  
Butterfly changes into a white gown, and her new husband gently leads her onto  
the terrace as vows of love flow from their lips.  
<P>Act II: Three years have passed since Pinkerton's departure, In a room of her  
house which looks into the garden and over the harbor, Butterfly stands rapt in  
thought as Suzuki prays to her Japanese gods that they may stop the tears of her  
mistress. Butterfly is annoyed. She has more faith in the American God-but  
unfortunately He does not seem to know where Butterfly lives. Her money is just  
about gone.and a catastrophe is imminent unless Pinkerton returns soon.  
Butterfly is sure that he will return. Does Suzuki not believe it? Well,  
Butterfly knows how it will be: One fine day we'll notice a thread of smoke  
arising on the sea in the far horizon... (See Butterfly's Aria).  
<P>Sharpless, guided by Goro, pays a visit to Butterfly. In her naive joy,  
Butterfly gives him at first no chance to fulfil the purpose of his visit: to  
read to her a letter he has received from Pinkerton. Butterfly indignantly tells  
the Consul how, during the three years since Pinkerton's departure, the marriage  
broker has continually offered her suitors. At the moment it is Prince  
Yamadori,a very rich one. Butterfly claims that she is still married, and that,  
according to American law, one cannot simply leave and forget his wife as one  
can do in Japan.  
<P>At last Sharpless can begin to read the letter, but when he reaches the  
critical words “...will you carefully prepare her... ”,Butterfly is so overjoyed  
that the Consul cannot bring himself to read on. With a curse for Pinkerton, he  
bluntly asks the girl what she would do if Pinkerton were never to return.  
Haltingly she stammers that she could be a geisha again, or better, she could  
die. When the Consul, filled with pity, suggests that she marry Yamador, her  
first impulse is to ask him to leave, but suddenly she runs into an adjoining  
room and returns with a small child. Can he forget this, she exclaims, this  
blue-eyed boy with blond curls? Will she have to carry him through rain and  
wind, begging and dancing, a geisha again? No, this shall never be, Rather than  
dance, she would die. Deeply moved, Sharpless promises to tell Pinkerton about  
his son and takes his leave.  
<P>At this moment the cannon of the harbor is heard firing, and Suzuki hurries  
in, saying that it is a warship. Butterfly in great excitement looks through a  
telescope and recognizes Pinkerton's ship, the Abraham Lincoln. Everyone has  
been lying to her, she exclaims; Pinkerton is back, her love is triumphant. She  
orders Suzuki to gather the blossoms from their cherry tree and to bring in all  
the flowers from the garden so that the house may be filled with the scent of  
spring. Reluctantly Suzuki obeys and, with her mistress, proceeds to strew the  
blossoms all over the room. Butterfly puts on the gown she wore on her wedding  
night and motions to Suzuki to close the screen that separates the room from the  
terrace. In the screen she makes three tiny holes through which they can observe  
the expected arriveal of Pinkerton. The light is fading as they gaze into the  
distance.  
<P>Act III: Night is gradually receding before the new day, but Butterfly still  
stands motionless, her gaze fixed on the harbor. Following Suzuki's advice,  
Butterfly retires for a brief rest.  
<P>Pinkerton and the Consul knock at the door and enter. Then Suzuki sees a lady  
in the garden and learns with horror that she is Pinkerton's wife, Kate.  
Sharpless asks Suzuki to comfort her mistress and to persuade her to give up her  
child to Kate. Pinkerton is overcome by his memories. Reproached by Sharpless  
and crushed by remorse, he bids a tearful farewell to the past and departs.  
<P>Butterfly rushes in, but does not dare ask the Consul about Pinkerton. Then  
she notices Kate and understands what is expected of her. Sadly she wishes Kate  
luck and promises to give the child to Pinkerton personally if he comes in half  
an hour.  
<P>The Consul and Kate leave. Butterfly falls weeping to the ground. When she  
comes to, she sends Suzuki out. Then she goes to the shrine, takes the dagger,  
and reads the inscription on the blade: “Death with honor is better than life  
with dishonor.” As she raises the dagger, the door opens and Suzuki's arm is  
seen pushing the child toward his mother. Butterfly hugs him hystericaly, then  
bids him a heart rending farewell, blindfolds him, and gives him an American  
flag to play with. Again taking the dagger, she moves behind a screen. The knife  
is heard dropping. Butterfly tries to crawl toward the child as Pinkerton,  
ascending the hill, is heard calling her name. By the time he reaches the  
threshold, Butterfly is dead.
