<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>THE GRAPES OF WRATH
<P>John Steinbeck
<P>In the Grapes of Wrath Steinbeck has achieved an interesting contrapuntal 
effect by breaking the narrative at intervals with short, impressionistic 
passages recorded as though by a motion picture camera moving quickly from one 
scene to another and from one focus to another. The novel is a powerful 
indictment of our capitalistic economy and a sharp criticism of the southwestern 
farmer for his imprudence in the care of his land. The outstanding feature of 
the Grapes of Wrath is its photographically detailed, if occasionally 
sentimentalized description of the American farmers of the Dust Bowl in the 
midthirties of the twentieth century. 
<P>Tom Joad was released from the Oklahoma state penitentiary where he had 
served a sentence for killing a man in self-defense. He traveled homeward 
through a region made barren by drought and dust storms. On the way he met Jim 
Casy an expreacher; the pair went together to the home of Tom's people. They 
found the Joad place deserted. While Tom and Casy were wondering what had 
happened, Muley Graves, a diehard tenant farmer, came by and disclosed that all 
of the families in the neighborhood had gone to California or were going. Tom's 
folks, Muley said, had gone to a relative's place preparatory to going west. 
Muley was the only sharecropper to stay behind. 
<P>All over the southern Midwest states, farmers, no longer able to make a 
living because of land banks, weather, and machine farming, had sold or were 
forced out of the farms they had tenanted. Junk dealers and used-car salesmen 
profiteered on them. Thousands of families took to the roads leading to the 
promised land, California. 
<P>Tom and Casy found the Joads at Uncle John's place all busy with preparations 
to leave for California. Assembled for the trip were Pa and Ma Joad; Noah, their 
mentally backward son, Al, the adolescent younger brother of Tom and Noah, Rose 
of Sharon, Tom's sister and her husband, Connie; the Joad children, Rothie and 
Winfield, and Granma and Grampa Joad. Al had bought an ancient truck to take 
them west. The family asked Jim Casy to go with them. 
<P>Spurred by handbills which stated that agricultural workers were badly needed 
in California, the Joads, along with thousands of others, made their tortuous 
way, in a worn out vehicle across the plains toward the mountains. Grampa died 
of a stroke during their first overnight stop. And, to add to the general 
misery, returning migrants told the Joads that there was no work to be had in 
California, that conditions were even worse than they were in Oklahoma. But the 
dream of a bountiful West Coast urged the Joads onward. 
<P>Close to the California line, where the group stopped to bathe in a river, 
Noah, feeling he was a hindrance to the others, wandered away. It was there that 
the Joads first heard themselves addressed as Okies, another word for tramps. 
<P>Granma died during the night trip across the desert. After burying her, the 
group went into a Hooverville, as the migrants' camps were called. There they 
learned that work was all but impossible to find. A contractor came to the camp 
to sign up men to pick fruit in another county. When the Okies asked to see his 
license, the contractor turned the leaders over to a police deputy who had 
accompanied him to camp. Tom was involved in the fight which followed. He 
escaped, and Casy gave himself up in Tom's place. Connie, husband of the 
pregnant Rose of Sharon, suddenly disappeared from the group. The family was 
breaking up in the face of its hardships. Ma Joad did everything in her power to 
keep the group together. 
<P>The Joads left Hooverville and went to a government camp maintained for 
transient agricultural workers. For the first time since they had arrived in 
California, the Joads found themselves treated as human beings. 
<P>Circumstances eventually forced them to leave the camp, however, for there 
was no work in the district. They drove to a large farm where work was being 
offered. There they found agitators attempting to keep the migrants from taking 
the work because of unfair wages offered. But the Joads, thinking only of food, 
were escorted by motorcycle police into the farm. The entire family picked 
peaches for five cents a box and earned in a day just enough money to buy food 
for one meal. Tom, remembering the pickets outside the camp, went out at night 
to investigate. He found Casy, who was the leader of the agitators. While Tom 
and Casy were talking, deputies, who had been searching for Casy, closed in on 
them. The pair fled, but were caught. Casy was killed. Tom received a cut on his 
head, but not before he had felled a deputy with an ax handle. The family 
concealed Tom in their shack. The rate for a box of peaches dropped, meanwhile, 
to two-and-a-half cents. Tom's danger and the futility of picking peaches drove 
the Joads on their way. They hid the injured Tom under the mattresses in the 
back of the truck. 
<P>The family found at last a migrant crowd encamped in abandoned boxcars along 
a stream. They joined the camp and soon found temporary jobs picking cotton. Ma, 
realizing that Tom was not safe, sent him away. 
<P>The Autumn rains began. Soon the stream which ran beside the camp overflowed 
and water entered the boxcars. Under these all but impossible conditions, Rose 
of Sharon gave birth to a dead baby. When the rising water made their position 
no longer bearable, the family moved from the camp on foot. The rains had made 
their old car useless. They came to a barn, which they shared with a boy and his 
starving father. Rose of Sharon, bereft of her baby, nourished the famished man 
with the milk from her breasts. So the poor kept each other alive in the 
depression years.
