<BODY bgColor=#9FCB74>Victor Hugo Condemning the Burning of the Winter Palace 
<P>Victor Hugo, 1802---1885, was a celebrated French literary giant. After the 
British and French invaders had burnt the Winter Palace in November, 1861, he 
wrote a reply to a lieutenant named Bartlette(?), denouncing indignantly the 
Allied atrocities. An extract of the letter follows. 
<P>“Sir, you ask me what I think of the expedition to China. You must feel that 
it was praiseworthy, well done. You are very polite, putting a high premium upon 
my feelings. In your opinion, the expedition, performed under the joint banner 
of Queen Victoria and Emperor Napoleon, was nothing short of a British-French 
glory. Therefore, you would like to know to what extent I appreciate this 
glory.” 
<P>Since you ask, I will answer as follows: 
<P>In a corner of the world there existed a man-made miracle --- the Winter 
Palace. Art has two sources: one, an ideal, whence has come European art; two, 
fancy, whence has issued Oriental art. The Winter Palace belongs in the art of 
fancy. The Winter Palace, indeed, was the crystalisation of all of the art that 
an almost superman race could have fancied. The Winter Palace was a hugescale 
prototype of fancy if fancy can have a prototype. If only you can imagine an 
ineffable architectural structure, like a palace in the moon, a fairyland, that 
is the Winter Palace. If you can imagine a treasure-island, a pool of human 
perceptive power, expressed in the concrete form of palaces and temples, that is 
the Winter Palace. It took two generations of manpower to create the Winter 
Palace, which subsequently went through improvement and perfection over several 
centuries. For whom was the Winter Palace built, after all? Eventually, for the 
people. Because as time passes by, all that the people has made remains in the 
possession of mankind. Great artists, poets, philosophers --- they all knew 
about the Winter Palace. Voltaire (Francois Marie Arouet)once talked about it. 
Many people at different times compared the Winter Palace to the Parthenon, the 
Pyramids, the Arena, the Notre Dame. If they could not see the Winter Palace 
with their own eyes, they could dream about it --- as if in the gloaming they 
saw a breath-taking masterpiece of art as they had never known before --- as if 
there above the horizon of European civilization was towering the silhouette of 
Asian civilization. 
<P>Now, the miracle is no more! One day, two pirates broke into it. One of them 
went plundering; the other set every building and everything in it all abaze! 
Judging by what they did, we know that the victors could degenerate into 
robbers. The two of them fell to dividing between themselves the spoils. What 
meritorious feats they had done! What a heaven-sent bonanza! One stuffed his 
pockets full to overflowing; the other filled in his trunck chockfull. Then, 
hand in hand they made off, guffawing gloatingly. This episode reflects the 
history of the two brigands. 
<P>Standing before the tribunal of history is one brigand named France and the 
other named Great Britain. Against both I protest. Incidentally, I must thank 
you for giving me the opportunity to make this accusation. The rulers commit 
crimes but the ruled do not. The government becomes a robber, but the people 
will never. 
<P>France has gained a large portion of the spoils. Now, quite naively, she 
thinks herself the rightful owner of the property, and she is displaying the 
riches of the Winter Palace! I can only hope that there will come one day when 
France will disburden herself of the heavy load on her conscience and cleanse 
herself of the crime by returning to China all the spoils taken from the Winter 
Palace. 
<P>Sir, such is my eulogy of the expedition to China.

1983 issue of the Beijing Evening News </P></BODY></HTML>
