        MICHAEL JORDAN as a <b>premier[2]</b> athlete who can run fast, jump 
        high and routinely deliver in the <b>clutch[3]</b>. To them, he's simply 
        physically <b>superior[4] </b>to his contemporaries.</p>

        <p align="left" class="e1">All this is true, but there are other truths 
        about Michael that are not so easily seen: his understanding of team 
        concepts, his competitive <b>drive[1]</b> and his compassion. It's these 
        hidden truths that form the deepest bond between Michael and me.</p>

        I must <b>confess[1] </b>to being spoiled by Michael's leadership and by 
        his ability to rise to every competitive occasion. He could easily 
        average around 30 points a game, but he's committed to team goals and to 
        making his teammates more effective.</p>

        <p align="left" class="e1">After coaching him for eight seasons, I still 
        <b>marvel[1]</b> at how much Michael's <b>enthusiasm[2]</b> energizes 
        us, even at practice. I mean he never takes a day off. As a player, I 
        had only modest skills, so I always had to operate at a maximum effort 
        to compete. His work ethic is an important personal bond between us.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>他很执着。<br>

        <p align="left" class="e1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing about 
        Michael is, he takes nothing about his game for granted. When he first 
        came to the NBA back in 1984, he was primarily a penetrator. His outside 
        shooting wasn't up to <b>pro[1]</b> standards. So he put in his gym time 
        during the off-season, shooting hundreds of shots each day. Eventually, 
        he became a deadly three-point shooter.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>例如，他曾苦练三分球。<br>
        pro[1]</b>.n.专业人员；职业人员</p>
        <p align="left" class="e1">Playing <b>outstanding[1]</b> defense didn't 
        come automatically to him, either. He had to study his opponents, learn 
        their favorite moves and then dedicate himself to learning the 
        techniques necessary to stop them. He's worked extremely hard to perfect 
        his footwork and his balance.</p>
