            flight to Quito. I had asked to visit the city as a last minute  
            change to my program, because l had wanted to see for myself the  
            part of the country which had been at the heart of the conflict. 　</TD>

          <TD width="65%" bgcolor="#CFF8DC">　As we drove to our next meeting  
            at the hospital,I thought about the disturbing stories Paul had told  
            me. Tragicallys these are everyday stories for the people living in  
            this region.Today, in what is supposed to be peacetime,it's mostly  
            women and children who are victims of land mines．women, because  
            they are the ones working inthehelds．and chndren,who play unaware  
            of the danger underfoot. The staff at the hospital told me they  
            admit mine casualties like this fourteen year- old boy weekly. His  
            family had recently returned home after the war. He'd been helping  
            to plant crops, not knowing the area around his home was mined．  
            He's lost most of his leg, and part of his face, All he was trying  
            to do was provide for his family.</TD>  
          <TD width="35%" bgcolor="#CFF8DC">　在我们驱车前往医院参加下一个会议的路上,我一  
            直想着保罗告诉我的那些令人不安的故事。可悲的是。  
            对于居住在这一地区的人来说,这些都是常事。在今天  
            这所谓的和平时代,地雷的牺牲者大多 是妇孺。妇女,是因为她  
            们要在田里 辛劳；儿童。是因为池们不知脚底的  
            危险而嘻戏 玩耍：医院的工作人员告诉我,他们每  
            星期都要接 纳象这个十四岁男孩一样的地雷伤残者,最近男孩的家人战后返家。他正帮助家人种植庄稼,却不知道他家那一片是雷区,他失去了大半条腿,脸部受损。而他只是想尽力而为养家。

          <TD width="65%" bgcolor="#CFF8DC">　He was typical of the innocent  
            ones. Before I came to Angola, I knew the facts, but the reality was  
            a shock. Here people are living with the knowledge that it is only  
            amatter of time before someone else is maimed or killed．It was  
            moving and encouraging to see the confidence shown by those learning  
            to walk again. But the millions of unexploded land mines in their  
            country will go on shattering lives for decades to come. If these  
            children are to have a future. we must end the use of these evil  
            weapons． The on1y way forward is for a total worldwide ban on  
            antipersonnel land mines.</TD>  
          <TD width="35%" bgcolor="#CFF8DC">他是许多无辜受害者的典型。我来安哥拉前,就有  
            所了解,可事实更令人震惊。在此居住的人们很清楚有人被炸死或炸伤只是个时间问题。看到那些重新学习走路的人所表现出来的自信真是令人鼓舞和感动。但在未来的几十年里,他们国家中成千上万未被引爆的地雷将会继续摧残生命。如果希望这些孩子拥有未来,我们必须停止使用这些邪恶的武器。唯一的出路就是在全球的范围内禁止杀伤性地雷。
