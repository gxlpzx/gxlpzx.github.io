Yes, South Africa has a bit of every country from around the world. In the very South of Africa, two oceans, the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean meet at the tip of the south coast. The seas on the east coast are warm, on the west coast are cold. In the west there are great deserts and in the east there are the most beautiful gardens in the world.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; South Africa is one of Africa's most popular tourist destinations. Why do millions of tourists visit South Africa every year? There are the big safari parks, the Kruger National Park is bigger than Holland. In the safari park you drive your own car, and sheep at night in a safe area away from the animals. Animals? Lions, elephants, giraffes, impala (a kind of deer), baboons, leopards, buffalo, crocodiles all live free in the park. You need to take your binoculars along with you, you can watch the lions feeds, the elephants romp and the cheetahs sprint.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; South Africa has more gold and diamonds than anywhere else in the world. The gold comes from the Witwatersrand, an area around Johannesburg, the biggest city in Africa. Diamonds come from a town called Kimberly, where the &quot;Kimberly diamond&quot;, the biggest diamond in the world was found. It now belongs to the Queen of England. If you go to Kimberly or Johannesburg you can take a trip in a real gold or diamond mine! There's a rule though, any gold or diamonds you find must be given back to the mine.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Inside South Africa there are some small kingdoms, with their own kings and government. One is called Swazilang, where the Swazi people live. Their biggest city is called Sun City, which is a little like Macau, with a lot of casinos.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; On the south coast is a province called Natal. Natal is very beautiful, with the warm Indian ocean, big green forests and it's always summer. Most of the people who live in Natal are Zulus. The Zulus used to be a fierce warrior tribe, and you can still watch their dances or buy some of their handicrafts.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; South Africa probably has the best sea-food in the world, with two big oceans and miles of coast. Prawns are as big as lobsters, mussels as big as plates. There are wines from the Cape Province, and lots and lots of meat. You can eat almost any kind of animal in South Africa, you can have ostrich eggs for breakfast, dried crocodile meat for lunch and grilled fish for supper.</font><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; If you want to go to South Africa you'll find it's very cheap, especially if you can drive a car. most people who go to South Africa often take a tent, so that they don't have to always live in hotels. There are special tours, called &quot;package tours&quot; where they will show you many different places in just one or two week.</font><center><p align=center><a href="index.html">［<font face="Times New Roman">BACK</font>］</a></center></td></tr><tr><td width=756 class=of12pt valign=top colspan=2><p align=center><b><font size=5 face="Times New Roman"><a name="Lateral Thinking Puzzle">Lateral Thinking Puzzle</a></font></b></p><p align=center><font face="Times New Roman">Excerpted by <b>HeFei</b></font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">A woman has two sons.

Success is the realization of one's hopes and justified ideals. Under such a general notion, however, people have different understandings of success because the hopes and ideals they cherish vary one another.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Here let me tell you a story of a young female college student.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Not long ago, she caught a terrible nerve disease known as facial paralysis. All of sudden the left side of her face got paralyzed, her mouth slid to one side, her eye couldn't close even slightly, and the muscles were completely stiff. Like a bolt from the blue, she was thrown into a total panic.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; What to do? With her parents, the student had visited all the hospitals in the city and tried every possible means, but none worked. As time went by, the situation became more and more urgent because the curable stage was slipping by quickly. She was so scared, but deep in her heart she still kept such a tiny sparkle of hope that things would be going better one day.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; At last she found her savior, miraculously. She was introduced to a venerable retired acupuncturist. The first time the acupuncturist saw her, he was also quite uncertain if there would be any hope, but still he accepted her. From that day on, the two started their long journey of treatment.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; After one month, those little silver needles did work marvelously! Some muscles of her face were able to move a little. Another month passed. Change could be seen on her eyelid. Step by step, after six months of continuous acupuncture treatment, she got better and recovered basically at last.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; On day of her leaving, the girl and her father presented a precious gift to the acupuncturist. It's a picture frame with the most sacred six-word blessing from her ethnic nationality: Om-Ma-Ni-Pad-Me-Hung.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Some little silver needles, a traditional Chinese acupuncturist and an ordinary college girl, together made the miracle happen! That is success.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Talking about success, what usually comes to our mind are those great achievements and shining cases. But to me, success is just in each time we rise up to challenges.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Why is success so dear to everybody? Because it is not easy to come by, because in the process of our striving for success, we have both our body and soul tempered, and we are enlightened by the most valuable qualities of human beings: confidence, love, courage, fortitude, patience and sense of responsibility. These are the best treasures a person can ever possess, and these have the greatest powers for us to strive for truth and happiness.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; My dear friends, now can you guess who that college student is?</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; It's me, who is standing here and speaking to you in earnest and sincerity. I'm so proud that I can take part in this competition within a year after I conquered such an obstinate disease. I am also proud that I come here today not only on behalf of myself and my university, but also on behalf of my successful family, a mixed family formed by a Tibetan father and a Han mother. I am so happy that I can do credit to my ethnic originality and that land which had reared and educated me.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; What is success? Everybody has his own interpretation just as I do. But there is one thing for sure: that is every success leads you to an ever brighter future.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; My friends, believe in yourselves that you can make the best of yourselves.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Wish you all good success.</font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>&nbsp; <i><b>By Kefei</b></i>, the second prize winner of the &quot;21st Century Cup&quot; English-language speaking competition on March 31, for her speeches on &quot; My definition of Success.&quot;</font></p><center><p align=center><a href="index.html">［<font face="Times New Roman">BACK</font>］</a></center></td></tr><tr><td width=756 class=of12pt valign=top colspan=2><p align=center><b><font size=5 face="Times New Roman"><a name="You Can't Change the Future">You Can't Change the Future</a></font></b></p><p align=center><font face="Times New Roman">Excerpted by <b>HeFei</b></font></p><p class=of12pt><font face="Times New Roman">Bill Evans was a professional baseball player.

This time of the year was a holiday in many parts of the world before it became the Christmas celebration. That's why some of the customs and traditions of Christmas go back to pagan time. The custom of giving presents goes back to the ancient Romans. In the Bible, the wise men brought gifts to Jesus on the 12th day after his birth. And so in some countries, the children receive their presents not on Christmas, but 12 days later. In some of northern countries of Europe, the gifts are exchanged almost three weeks before Christmas. The reason for this is that the gifts are supposed to be brought in by Saint Nicholas in the eve of his feast day, December the 6th. Saint Nicholas was a bishop of the 4th century who came to be regarded as a special friend of the children. So in various countries around the world Saint Nicholas returns every year with gifts for good children. When the Dutch came to New York, they brought the tradition of Saint Nicholas with them. They called him &quot; San Nicholas.&quot; And this soon was changed to &quot; Sankt Klaus&quot;, and then Santa Claus. But in this century we moved the date of his arrival to Christmas Eve. And gradually his red costume, the reindeer, and his home at the north pole became part of tradition.</font></p><center><p align=center><a href="index.html">［<font face="Times New Roman">BACK</font>］</a></center></td></tr><tr><td width=756 class=of12pt valign=top colspan=2><p align=center><font face="Times New Roman" size=5><b><a name="Why do we celebratethe new year?">Why do we celebratethe new year?</a></b></font></p><p align=center><font face="Times New Roman"><b>He Fei</b>, <i>Class 104</i></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; One of the oldest customs of mankind is the celebration of the new year. Some people say the Chinese were the first to start it, others believe it was the ancient Germans, and still others claim it was Romans. We know that the Chinese have always had a great festival at the time of their new year which comes later than ours. The ancient Germans established a new year festival because of the changing seasons. The German winter began about the middle of November. This was the time when they gathered the harvest, because everybody came together at this time for the happy occasion, and because it meant they would have a period of rest from work afterwards. they would make merry and have a great holiday. Even though it was November, they considered this time of celebration is the first of January. From then the coming of the new year was a symbol of a new life with new hope for the future. This custom and this meaning has lasted to this day. We celebrate the new year hoping it will bring us a good life!</font></p><center><p align=center><a href="index.html">［<font face="Times New Roman">BACK</font>］</a></center></td></tr></table></div><hr size=0 width=760><p align=center style=150%;30><font size=4><b>文章版权属于作者</b></font><font size=4><b><br>版权所有 2000-2001 姚舸 保留一切权利<br>Copyright&copy; 2000-2001 Ge Yao,All Rights Reserved.</b></font></p></body></html>
