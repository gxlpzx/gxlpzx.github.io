    fighter is the first jet fighter designed and produced all by Chinese technology itself. 
    It is also the first fighter of China not following the design of USSR, which grounds the 
    basic of China jet fighter developing projects. But J-12 never entered the service because 
    of its own death-wound.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#FF0000">歼-12</font><font size="2">轻型战斗机是我国第一种完全依靠本国技术力量进行设计和制造的喷气战斗机。它摆脱前苏联系列飞机的设计格局，为我国独立自主研制战斗机奠定了良好基础。但由于歼-12的一系列致命弱点，它最终夭折，从未正式服役。</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Before the Culture Revolution, the PLA airforce started the &quot;Small 
    Fighter&quot; project during Apr 1967, which was greatly effected by the political 
    thoughts and leaders` preach. The project emphasized that the new fighter should be 
    smaller, lighter and more agile. This was based on the theroy of &quot;Air 
    bushfighting&quot; and carried out a agile, short distance takeoff and landing, easy 
    maintenance and low cost small fighter. In 1969 Nanchang Airplane Company took the job and 
    denominated it &quot;J-12&quot; the next year. J-12 first flied in Dec 1970, then made a 
    great air show for the leaders of the PLA. Marshal Ye Jianying called J-12 &quot;Air Li 
    Xiangyang&quot; after the show, and Li Xiangyang is a famous guerilla captain in Chinese 
    movie. The Marshal hoped that J-12 would be as heroism as Li Xiangyang and J-12 did it in 
    maneuverability area. The pilots of J-12 all admirationd this.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">文革前夕我国空军受到政治思想和部分上层人物鼓吹的影响，于67年4月启动“小歼”的研制计划。计划突出新歼击机要小、轻、灵，按当时“开展空中游击战”的设计思想，本意是要研制一种高机动灵活，短距起降，维护简单，造价低廉的小型战斗机。69年南昌飞机制造厂正式接受了研制任务，次年3月正式定名“歼-12”。原型机于1970年12月首飞成功，73年9月向中央领导做汇报表演，当时叶剑英元帅赞誉其为“空中李向阳”。名如其机，歼-12飞机机动性确实相当不错，参加试飞的飞行员赞叹有加。</font></p>
    <p><img src="j12_2.jpg" border="1" width="760" height="500"></p>
    <p><font size="2">The takeoff weight of J-12 is 4,450kg as well as the fuselage weight is 
    just 3,100kg, both are the lightest record of jet fighters in the world. Due to the body 
    is so small, the thrust of the engine is quite large. But the weight and size are just the 
    death-wounds of J-12, too. There`s limited space of weapons, the weapon includes one 23mm 
    gun and one 30mm gun, which are internal. And it can carry two air-to-air short range 
    missles. This might be the weakest scheme of jet fighters. Because of the limited weight 
    and head air intake design, the aviatic eletronic suites were cut down. There was no radar 
    in the plane which damage the effetion of the fighter. Another problem is that there`s not 
    enough space for fuel so that J-12`s voyage is very poor. These all caused the death of 
    the J-12.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">歼-12正常起飞重量为4450千克，空机重量只有3100千克，占据世界超音速战斗机的“最轻”冠军。由于机体重量轻，相对而言推重比较大，机动性也就相对的好。但重量轻体积小也恰恰是歼-12的致命弱点，其安装武器的空间很有限，固定武器是一门30mm航炮及一门23mm航炮，外挂两枚红外格斗空空导弹，这在超音速战斗机中算是火力较弱的了。由于有重量限制，加上其机头进气布局，歼-12的电子火控设备被最大幅度的压缩了。机上没有机载雷达，战斗力大受影响。机体轻小的另一个致命弱点是机体内空间有限，无法装载足够的燃油，航程自然很短。这两个弱点直接导致了歼-12胎死腹中。</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Though J-12 has all these problems, considering the situation and the 
    technology at that time, Nanchang Airplane Company used many new technique and made some 
    great achievement in certain areas of the fighter. This are the good side of the J-12 
    project.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">尽管歼-12有种种弱点，但南昌飞机公司在当时的大环境和技术条件下，采用诸多新颖技术，在飞机性能的某些方面获得了很大成功，这是歼-12研制中可取的地方。</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There are two different design of J-12s, one contains a cone shaped 
    centrebody in the air intake, the speed pipe are at the bottom of the edge of air intake. 
    Another design has no centerbody and the pipe is on the top of the air intake.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">歼-12几架原型机有两种不同设计，一种带有激波锥，空速管在进气道下方。另外一种无激波锥，空速管在上方。</font></p>
